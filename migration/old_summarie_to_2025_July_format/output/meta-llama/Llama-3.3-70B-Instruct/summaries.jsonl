Instead, the study suggests that pure discrimination against women may be a factor, although it notes that younger women (under 40) are negotiating pay rises as successfully as their male counterparts, potentially indicating a shift in negotiating behavior.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He made a breakthrough in decoding genes by focusing on messenger molecules (RNA) and later founded a private research institute and a commercial company, Celera Genomics. His work led to the publication of the human genome in 2001, and he has since pursued other projects, including the creation of a synthetic life form, Synthia, and a genetic treasure hunt to sequence genomes from microbes living in the sea.

The study also found that boys are three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls. Additionally, the research showed that contact with the juvenile justice system can inadvertently reproduce the conditions in which violence can flourish. The study's findings suggest that crime is highly concentrated in poor communities, with half of the communities with the highest crime rates also experiencing high levels of chronic health problems and a third experiencing high levels of unemployment.

Just a year ago, they could command prices of up to £1.2 million, but now they are being sent to slaughterhouses and their meat is being used in cheap hotpots. The decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has stopped wealthy businessmen from giving the dogs as gifts to influence officials, and recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities. The breed's popularity was also affected by unscrupulous breeding practices, which led to a glut of poor-quality dogs, and the realization that Tibetan Mastiffs are not well-suited to city living. As a result, hundreds of the dogs are feared to be meeting a cruel fate, with many being stolen, sold to slaughterhouses, or abandoned.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

If the code is not entered, access is refused. A 14-character recovery key can be used to regain access if the trusted device is lost or stolen.
