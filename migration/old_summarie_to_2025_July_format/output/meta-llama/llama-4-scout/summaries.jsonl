The Finnish researchers analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two increased the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing off beneficial gut bugs, leading to increased appetite and weight gain. The findings highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-scout", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

However, with the introduction of new printing technology and the move of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's papers to Wapping in 1986, the area's grip on journalism began to crumble. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away, and the buildings have since been repurposed, with some now housing businesses like Pizza Express and Sainsbury's.

Analysis of soil samples and plant fossils suggests that they were built in areas with taller vegetation, and were not visible above the forest canopy.

The review's final report recommended that the procedures not be offered routinely, but rather as one of several treatment options, with patients making informed choices. The report also called for mandatory reporting of adverse events. Despite calls for a ban, the Scottish government will implement the recommendations, as it does not have the power to ban the procedures, which lies with the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. An independent expert, Professor Alison Britton, will examine the review process to identify lessons for the future. The controversy surrounding the review has included resignations from some panel members, who expressed concerns about the report's conclusions.

The industry, which voted heavily to leave the EU, hopes to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the report notes that most commercial fish stocks are in shared waters with EU coastal states, and that continued market access to the EU may be necessary. This access may come at a price, with the EU potentially demanding more access to UK waters in return for tariff-free exports. The report also highlights the need to retain some elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) post-Brexit, such as quotas based on scientific advice. The UK's departure from the EU may lead to different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite concerns, the industry remains optimistic about the future, with some seeing Brexit as an opportunity for \"fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management\".", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-scout", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In contrast, Germany offers high-quality vocational education, with 51% of employers offering apprenticeships, compared to 20% in England. The report calls for a radical expansion of apprenticeships, with up to 300,000 new starts each year, mostly at level three or higher, and for at least three years.

Animal welfare workers have rescued groups of the dogs, finding them in cramped cages, malnourished, and injured.

Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two increased the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing off beneficial gut bugs, leading to increased appetite and weight gain.

The report suggests that councils sell expensive social housing (worth more than the average property in each region) to invest in more social housing, reducing the waiting list of 1.8 million people by around 500,000. The proposal could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s. However, Labour has criticized the idea, saying it would drive out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighborhoods and create segregated communities of rich and poor. The government has stated that councils can already choose to sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing, but Labour argues that the coalition's policies are making the housing crisis worse.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-scout", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

When comparing like-for-like full-time and part-time workers, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked. The research, which controlled for factors such as employer size and industry, found no evidence that women avoid asking for a pay rise due to concerns about upsetting their boss or deviating from female stereotypes. The study suggests that there may be some level of discrimination against women, with the researchers finding that unsuccessful men who ask for a pay rise may be more likely to keep it to themselves, while women are more straightforward about sharing their experiences. The findings also suggest that negotiating behaviour may be changing, with women and men under 40 asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-scout", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
