However, the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown and recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities have led to a collapse in the mastiff market. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin is used to make leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued a group of 20 mastiffs on their way to a slaughterhouse, with many already dead or suffering from neglect.

Venter then focused on creating a synthetic life form, called Synthia, which was published in the journal Science after a decade of work. Venter's journey began in Vietnam, where he was inspired to become a doctor and later excelled in research. He made a breakthrough in decoding genes by focusing on messenger molecules (RNA) rather than the DNA blueprint. This led to the creation of a private research institute and a commercial company, Celera Genomics, which successfully sequenced the human genome in 2001.

The breed, which can weigh up to 80 kg, was previously highly sought after and could command prices of up to £1.2 million. However, the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown and recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities have led to a collapse in the mastiff market. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin is used to make leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued a group of 20 mastiffs on their way to a slaughterhouse, with many already dead or suffering from neglect. The breed's decline is also attributed to unscrupulous breeders who have damaged the quality of the breed through cross-breeding and ruthless gangs stealing dogs from the streets to sell to slaughterhouses.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
