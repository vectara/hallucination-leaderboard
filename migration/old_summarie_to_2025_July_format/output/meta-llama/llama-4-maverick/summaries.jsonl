The study, which analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, found that repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two increased the likelihood of being overweight. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than those who hadn't received the drugs. The researchers suggested that antibiotics may cause weight gain by killing off gut bugs that normally feed on food, freeing up more energy for the body, and potentially increasing appetite.

The UK's armed forces have been significantly reduced, with the Army shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy having only 19 warships, and the RAF having just 7-8 front-line fast jet squadrons. The UK has fallen to sixth place in global defence spending, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France, and is likely to fall below the Nato threshold of spending 2% of GDP on defence. The next government will likely have to make further cuts to defence, with the Ministry of Defence having the second-largest non-protected budget of £34bn. The Conservatives, Labour, and Lib Dems have not committed to ring-fencing defence spending, and the MoD is expected to lose £2-3bn of its annual budget. The parties have differing stances on renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent, with the Conservatives and UKIP committed to a like-for-like replacement, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and others propose alternatives or scrapping it altogether.

The industry has long been dissatisfied with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which it sees as a disaster for Britain. While Brexit may allow the UK to regain control over its waters, it also risks marginalizing fishing communities in the wider negotiations. The UK's fishing industry is relatively small, producing 0.5% of GDP and employing 12,000 people, but it is crucial for certain coastal communities. The industry relies heavily on exports, mainly to the EU, and any trade deal may require the UK to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters. The House of Lords report recommends that the UK retain elements of the CFP, such as basing total allowable catches on scientific advice, and continue to cooperate with neighboring states. However, Brexit may lead to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite concerns, many in the industry remain optimistic about the future, believing that Brexit will bring fairer shares in catching opportunities and better fisheries management.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-maverick", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The PDP, which had been in power for 16 years, lost key northern states and the presidential poll last month. The APC's victory is seen as a historic gain, relegating the PDP to a regional party with a presence mainly in the south-east. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east, and held on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The elections were marred by some violence, but were generally more peaceful than in previous years. The results have significant implications for the incoming president, Muhammadu Buhari, particularly in the oil-producing states where the APC failed to win.

The retreat is not uniform, with the southern sectors experiencing greater losses, such as the Belledonne Massif where glaciers have almost completely disappeared. The study suggests that the greater loss in the south is due to lower elevation and different climatic conditions.

The study attributes the increase in excessive drinking to changing social norms, increased affluence, decreased alcohol prices, and increased alcohol advertising. About 88,600 US deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking is estimated at over $220 billion per year.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-maverick", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The WHO states that caesareans should only be performed when medically necessary, as they can lead to infections, complications, and even death. In England, over a quarter of women giving birth have a caesarean, more than double the rate since the early 1990s, with some women opting for planned caesareans due to anxiety. The WHO recommends a caesarean rate of 10-15%, citing the dangers and costs involved, with a planned caesarean costing the NHS £2,369 on average, compared to £1,665 for a natural birth. This contradicts current NHS guidelines, which allow women to have caesareans without medical justification, particularly if they have tokophobia (fear of childbirth).", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "llama-4-maverick", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Depay has had a prolific season, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games, and has attracted interest from other top European clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain. PSV technical director Marcel Brands confirmed that United are in pole position to sign Depay, but that \"bigger amounts of money\" are being discussed. Depay has already impressed at international level, scoring for Holland at the 2014 World Cup and being nominated for the tournament's 'best young player' award.

Animal welfare workers have rescued dogs being transported to slaughterhouses, finding them in cramped cages without food or water, and some with broken bones.
