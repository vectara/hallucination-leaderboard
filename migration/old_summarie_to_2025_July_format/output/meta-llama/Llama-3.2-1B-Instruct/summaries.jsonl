However, cultural studies professor Julie Roberts argued that the incident sets up a culture that drinking is about individual consumption, rather than socializing with friends. Roberts also pointed out that the media and government officials have reacted poorly to the event, labeling Abbott \"un-Australian\" for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign.
