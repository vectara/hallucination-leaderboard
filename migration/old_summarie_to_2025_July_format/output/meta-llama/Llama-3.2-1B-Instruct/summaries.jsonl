However, cultural studies professor Julie Roberts argued that the incident sets up a culture that drinking is about individual consumption, rather than socializing with friends. Roberts also pointed out that the media and government officials have reacted poorly to the event, labeling Abbott \"un-Australian\" for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign.

Wealthy businessmen once gave Tibetan Mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions, but the anti-corruption drive has made it difficult for them to do so. The breed's weight, which can reach up to 80 kg, has also been affected by a ban on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are now being stolen from the streets and sold to slaughterhouses, with some being found in cramped cages and suffering from broken bones.
