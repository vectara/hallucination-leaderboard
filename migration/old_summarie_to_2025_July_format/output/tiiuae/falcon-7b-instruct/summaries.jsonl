A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents.\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys.

The decision aims to improve on the current tracking system that relies on ground-based radars. The WRC, organized by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), agreed to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes. This will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world.\" The disappearance of Flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

The Sinn Féin MLA is challenging that decision in a separate court action. In a statement, Mr Elliott said: \"I have been totally vindicated and Phil Flanagan has admitted that the comments he made were totally untrue. I am very disappointed that it has taken so long to get to this stage. \"This could have been resolved 19 months ago, but unfortunately I was forced to go down this route. Despite that, I am delighted with the result.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

{"article_id": 432, "summary_uid": "39c6da725cfa1f31d5286c823742f572", "summary": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.

According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking youngster for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool.

According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown Police Department. If in fact you did purchase something, you are a victim as well and EPD will assist you in seeking restitution via the court prosecution of this case. Anyone with information can also contact the police department at 508-627-4343.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates was not qualified to be on the force and received preferential treatment because he made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training.

One of the challenges the Chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertibles Audi's from long range. 17-goal man Hazard and youngster Ake took on Blues teammates Loic Remy and Willian. From there, they took to a makeshift tennis court, where the net was replaced by a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the players had to hit the ball over the top of it.

The survey found that half of the women had been harassed before the age of 18, with the majority of the incidents occurring on the Paris metro. The survey also found that women were more likely to be victims of sexual harassment than men, with six out of ten women being afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men. The report called for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains, as well as better education for women to recognize and report harassment.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet. This was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990, according to research published in Prof Spiegelhalter's book, Sex by Numbers. According to the daily telegraph, he told BBC Radio 10's Woman's Hour programme that 'we used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated.' In his book, Prof Spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity, including people living on their own, a rise in work-related stress, and a decrease in the number of sexual partners.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents.\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy.

The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video. Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her. The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test. Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation. Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said: 'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The decision aims to improve on the current tracking system that relies on ground-based radars. The WRC, organized by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), agreed to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes. This will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world.\" The disappearance of Flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

{"article_id": 432, "summary_uid": "39c6da725cfa1f31d5286c823742f572", "summary": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.

Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

As well as providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking youngster for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool. Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition. She said: \"This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on. \"Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images. \"I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood. \"People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else. \"But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed. \"I didn't want it to be just happy memories, I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood. \"I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood.\" Growing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Last month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money. He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing. At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater. And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer. The club added: \"The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the signing of the player.\" Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros (£48.6m).", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects -- including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. Experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called endopredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500.

She was charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $ 250, and malicious destruction of property. According to the police report, Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home. She claimed that she owned the house. When Conklin confronted her, she fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away. According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown Police Department.

One of the challenges the Chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertibles Audi's from long range. 17-goal man Hazard and youngster Ake took on Blues teammates Loic Remy and Willian. From there, they took to a makeshift tennis court, where the net was replaced by a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the players had to hit the ball over the top of it.

The final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range, with Remy and Willian winning.

A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents.\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys.

The man places his hand in the tank and gently cups the fish with his fingers. The fish then relaxes in the man's hand and stays still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger. The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man's fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man's hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the fish with his fingers. The fish then buries its face into his hand and remains very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged. But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it became frustrated if he didn't play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand. The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.'

The decision aims to improve on the current tracking system that relies on ground-based radars. The WRC, organized by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), agreed to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes. This will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world.\" The disappearance of Flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

{"article_id": 432, "summary_uid": "39c6da725cfa1f31d5286c823742f572", "summary": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The blaze quickly spread, and the ship's passengers and crew were evacuated onto lifeboats. Three people were injured, and one was reportedly seriously hurt. The ship was about 27km (17 miles) from Mallorca when the fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon. Several ships, including two passenger ferries, were sent to help. The passengers and crew on the life rafts eventually boarded one of the ferries, the Puglia. Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Palma de Mallorca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours' time. Psychologists were asked to go to the port to provide counselling. The ferry, owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, sent out distress signals at 13:50 local time (11:50 GMT), said Spain's Ministry of Public Works.

As well as providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking youngster for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool. Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition. She said: \"This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on. \"Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images. \"I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood. \"People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else. \"But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed. \"I didn't want it to be just happy memories, I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood. \"I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood.\" Growing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects -- including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. Experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called endopredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500.

She was charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $ 250, and malicious destruction of property. According to the police report, Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home. She claimed that she owned the house. When Conklin confronted her, she fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away. According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown Police Department.

In round one, the Chelsea stars aimed to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range, with Hazard and Ake securing the points with a 5-3 win. One of the challenges the Chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertibles Audi's from long range. 17-goal man Hazard and youngster Ake took on Blues teammates Loic Remy and Willian. From there, they took to a makeshift tennis court, where the net was replaced by a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the players had to hit the ball over the top of it. Once again, Hazard and Ake came up trumps, winning the decider to take a 6-0 lead after the first two rounds. In the final challenge, Hazard posed next to a £127,000 R8 V10 Plus Audi, which played the part of a tennis net in one challenge. The final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range, with Remy and Willian winning.

A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents.\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys.

Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors. The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities. But Mexican food fans should know that the restaurant plans to add a nine per cent service charge - with the delivery fees for Postmates beginning at $5 and up, depending on distance and demand. New venture: Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors. Chipotle is thought to have turned down previous offers of collaboration with third-party delivery services - but has now given Postmates the green light. The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis. Chipotle has gone from strength to strength in recent years and this month two presidential candidates have been spotted in their restaurants. Republican contender Marco Rubio is a regular in the outlets and recently told MailOnline that he always tips staff. Cashing on delivery market: Chipotle is not the only franchise hoping to cash in on the lucrative delivery market. Starbucks, which will deliver cups of coffee in parts of Seattle and New York by the end of the year, has also partnered with Postmates. Taco Bell recently announced plans to test a delivery service this year, McDonald's 'McDelivery' program is in the planning process, and Burger King has launched a pilot program in select markets, including parts of New York City, through bkdelivers.com.

The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged. But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it became frustrated if he didn't play with it on a daily basis.

When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off.

The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash.

The decision aims to improve on the current tracking system that relies on ground-based radars. The WRC, organized by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), agreed to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes. This will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world.\" The disappearance of Flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

{"article_id": 432, "summary_uid": "39c6da725cfa1f31d5286c823742f572", "summary": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35. NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: \"The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr Hall and Mr Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb (26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William Nickerson but a picture of Nathan Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (Â£7,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco. Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges. The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Between the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club £106.8m. Last month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money. He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing. At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater. And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer. The club added: \"The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the signing of the player. \"Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations.\"", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

As well as providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking youngster for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900. The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones, Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool. Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool's collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition. She said: \"This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on. \"Looking through hundreds of different postcards, photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images. \"I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood. \"People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they're from Liverpool or anywhere else. \"But, at the same time, the pictures also remind us of how things have changed. \"I didn't want it to be just happy memories, I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood. \"I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood.\" Growing Up in the City is at the Museum of Liverpool until 25 September.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. \"All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,\" he said. \"The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they ended up there by accident.\" The report presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9 pm Thursday night.

Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama's defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music, and yelling at the world at large. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Yeaman was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects -- including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue -- can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. Experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called endopredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500.

According to the police report, Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home. She claimed that she owned the house. When Conklin confronted her, she fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away.

On the pitch this season, Chelsea have been hitting their targets and off it, Eden Hazard and three of his teammates have been doing the same. Taking part in Audi's Football Challenge, Hazard and Ake paired up to take on Loic Remy and Willian in a head-to-head challenge for the car manufacturer's prize. In round one, the Chelsea stars aimed to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range, with Hazard and Ake securing the points with a 5-3 win. One of the challenges the Chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertibles Audi's from long range. 17-goal man Hazard and youngster Ake took on Blues teammates Loic Remy and Willian. From there, they took to a makeshift tennis court, where the net was replaced by a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the players had to hit the ball over the top of it. Once again, Hazard and Ake came up trumps, winning the decider to take a 6-0 lead after the first two rounds. In the final challenge, Hazard posed next to a £127,000 R8 V10 Plus Audi, which played the part of a tennis net in one challenge. The final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range, with Remy and Willian winning. Hazard threw footballs up to his teammate Ake, who tried to fire them into the boot of an Audi. Willian and Remy redeemed themselves to produce a shock win over their team-mates, but the pair were involved in the biggest misfortune of the day on their way to victory.", "company": "tiiuae", "model_name": "falcon-7b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
