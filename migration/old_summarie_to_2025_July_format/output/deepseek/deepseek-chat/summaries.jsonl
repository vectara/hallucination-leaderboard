The researchers suggest that antibiotics, which are used to fatten farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. It found that children who had taken antibiotics as infants were particularly likely to be overweight, with boys being more prone to weight gain and slightly taller than those not given antibiotics. The study did not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship but hypothesized that antibiotics might alter gut bacteria, potentially increasing appetite and contributing to obesity.

Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, who worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, were among the last journalists based there. Fleet Street was renowned for its numerous pubs and the intense atmosphere of news production, with nearly every national paper having offices within a half-mile radius. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published there in 1702. However, the street's significance began to wane with the advent of television and social media, and the move of many newspapers to new locations in the 1980s, such as Rupert Murdoch's relocation to Wapping. The passage also highlights the sexism and heavy drinking culture that characterized Fleet Street during its heyday. With the closure of the Sunday Post's London office, the era of Fleet Street as a central hub for British journalism has officially ended.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Instead, they may have been sporadic ritual gathering places, similar to Maya pyramids or Stonehenge. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, making them less visible than other ritual sites. The research also challenges the assumption that the Amazonian forests were pristine before European arrival, indicating human influence over 6,000 years through selective cultivation of economically valuable trees, akin to a \"prehistoric supermarket.\" There is evidence that some modern Amazonian forests retain a legacy of these ancient agroforestry practices.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that the frequency of sex among Britons has been decreasing since the advent of the internet. A study by Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, reveals that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives due to constant connectivity, which leaves less \"quiet empty time\" for intimacy. He also notes that technological advancements have blurred the boundaries between home, work, and the outside world, making people busier and reducing the time spent with partners. A researcher adds that with more demands on time, sex becomes a lower priority, and late-night work emails can further distract from focusing on a partner.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The decline is attributed to several factors, including the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which made it less acceptable to give or receive the dogs as gifts. Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have significantly impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, Tibetan Mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skins for leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued groups of these dogs from cramped cages, many of which were in poor health. The breed's quality has also suffered due to unscrupulous breeding practices, leading to a glut of poor-quality dogs that cannot be sold.

A planned caesarean costs the NHS £2,369 on average, compared to £1,665 for a natural birth. The WHO's stance contradicts current NHS guidelines, which allow the procedure even without medical justification, particularly for women with tokophobia or previous complicated births.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Ram and thousands like him have been denied these rights due to concerns over upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. The recent success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party in state elections has given them hope for change. Around 100,000 West Pakistan refugees (WPRs) live in the Jammu region, mostly in poverty, with many marrying within their community due to their low economic status. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which has joined a Kashmir governing coalition, is expected to champion the WPRs' cause, potentially granting them state-subject rights and improving their conditions.

Design groups from Makerversity created prototypes to tackle these issues, with three finalists: 'Snooze,' an alarm clock that silences phone notifications; 'Forget Me Lock,' a device that indicates door lock status; and 'Nipper,' a compact phone charger. The public can vote on Twitter for their favorite, and the winner will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Other notable designs included a helmet with bone conduction headphones for cyclists and a parking pin that alerts users to free spaces.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The prosecutor suggested that Costa might have feigned memory loss, but Mullen denied this. Costa's state of mind is critical to the case, as a not guilty verdict can be returned if his unstable mindset at the time of the attack can be proven.", "company": "deepseek", "model_name": "deepseek-chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This map, produced using data from the Dark Energy Camera and the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, is part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), which aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years. The map shows clumps of dark matter in red and sparse regions in blue, and it allows astronomers to study how galaxies formed. The DES uses gravitational lensing to detect dark matter's effects on galaxies, as dark matter itself is invisible.

Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, making them less visible than other ritual sites.

The UK government responds by stating that the Scottish government will have an additional £390m in spending next year, and suggests that Scotland should focus on utilizing its new powers effectively.

Research indicates that the frequency of sex among Britons has been decreasing since the advent of the internet. A study by Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, reveals that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives due to constant connectivity, which leaves less \"quiet empty time\" for intimacy. He also notes that technological advancements have blurred the boundaries between home, work, and the outside world, making people busier and reducing the time spent with partners.
