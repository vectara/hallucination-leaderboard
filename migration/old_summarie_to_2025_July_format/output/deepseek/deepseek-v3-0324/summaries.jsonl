War*, completed by opposition figures led by Ilya Yashin after Boris Nemtsov's murder, accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the Ukraine conflict for political gain. It compiles evidence—previously reported in media—of Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine, including testimonies from soldiers admitting they were deployed by Russian generals, not separatists. The report estimates Russia’s war costs at 53bn roubles and highlights soldiers' salaries and unfulfilled compensation promises to families of the dead. Despite documented unit details and weapon photos, verification is difficult. While some Russians accept Moscow’s role, the opposition argues Putin engineered the war to revive his popularity. Publishing the report has faced challenges due to fear among publishers, and its impact may be limited, like Nemtsov’s past critical works.  \n\n**Key Points:**  \n1. Report accuses Putin of directing the war in Ukraine.  \n2. Cites Russian soldiers’ admissions of state-led operations.  \n3. Details financial costs and unpaid compensations to soldiers’ families.  \n4. Notes challenges in verifying evidence and distributing the report.  \n5.
