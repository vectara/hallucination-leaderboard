The app, launched last year, has been downloaded over five million times and utilizes features like Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) and similar Android features to enable message and photo sharing within a local network of up to around 30 feet. The app creates 'chatrooms' for nearby users or all users, with messages sent securely and anonymously.\n\nTo extend the range of these mesh networks beyond their current limit of around 200 feet, Open Garden developed Greenstone, an egg-shaped device that acts as a beacon or booster. Greenstone is designed to help messages travel further within these networks, with a current range of around 20 feet. It can hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages and has a one-year battery life. Greenstone is still under development and is intended for use in various scenarios where resilient communication is needed, such as events or emergencies.
