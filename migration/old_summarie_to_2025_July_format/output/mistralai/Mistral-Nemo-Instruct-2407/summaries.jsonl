Chelsea has made an offer, believed to be around £4 million, and would like to loan Muto to Vitesse Arnhem next season. Muto, however, wants to join a club where he can play regularly and develop his potential. FC Tokyo's president confirmed Chelsea's interest, and Muto has acknowledged the offer but is still thinking about it. Real Zaragoza's former manager, Ranko Popovic, who gave Muto his debut, believes Muto could be a great fit for Chelsea due to his intelligence, speed, strength, and confidence. Chelsea's manager, Jose Mourinho, has acknowledged Muto but refrained from commenting further, stating that it's not nice to speak about another team's player. Chelsea's transfer policy considers both commercial interests and the player's quality.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
