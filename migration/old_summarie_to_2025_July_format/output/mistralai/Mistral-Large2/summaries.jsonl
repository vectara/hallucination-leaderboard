The study, published in Pediatrics, compared over 12,000 two-year-olds' weight and height with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese, with those given antibiotics as babies being particularly at risk. Repeated prescriptions before age two also increased the likelihood of being overweight. Boys were more prone to weight gain and were slightly taller if given antibiotics. While the study didn't prove causation, it suggests that antibiotics may contribute to childhood obesity by altering gut bacteria, potentially freeing up more food for the body and increasing appetite. The lead author warned about the judicious use of antibiotics due to their potential role in the childhood obesity epidemic and other health issues.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Large2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The passage argues that the U.S. would be stronger if half of the companies were run by women and half of the households were run by men.\n\n4. **Response to Rios**: Rios' statement that she would move to Canada if Clinton is elected is countered by the fact that Canada already had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Large2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A survey of 2,000 people identified top \"everyday emergencies,\" with not being able to sleep ranking highest. Three shortlisted products were designed by groups from Makerversity:\n\n1. **Snooze**: An alarm clock that connects with your phone to silence notifications for better sleep.\n2. **Forget Me Lock**: A device that attaches to a key and indicates whether the door is locked or unlocked.\n3. **Nipper**: A small mobile phone charger powered by any household battery.\n\nThe public can vote for their favorite product on Twitter by retweeting specific tweets. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will proceed to a Kickstarter campaign for development. Other notable designs that didn't make the cut include a smart helmet with bone conduction headphones, a parking pin that alerts when a space is free, and an app called Relay for sending messages when a phone dies.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Large2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The purpose of these sites remains unclear, but they are thought to have been used sporadically for rituals, unlike villages or defensive structures. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests these geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation and not visible above the forest canopy. The research also indicates that humans have been influencing the Amazonian forests for at least 6,000 years, selectively cultivating valuable trees, a practice likened to a \"prehistoric supermarket.\" This historical human activity may still impact the biodiversity of Acre's remaining forests today.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Large2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Rancadore's solicitor, Karen Todner, expects the Italian government to withdraw the arrest warrant, allowing Rancadore to live in peace in England with his family. The case will still be heard by the Italian Supreme Court. Rancadore was first arrested in 2013 and had lived under the name Marc Skinner for two decades.

Repeated prescriptions before age two also increased the likelihood of being overweight. Boys were more prone to weight gain and were slightly taller if given antibiotics. While the study didn't prove causation, it suggests that antibiotics may contribute to childhood obesity by altering gut bacteria, potentially freeing up more food for the body and increasing appetite.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Hormones and Leadership**: A Texas businesswoman, Cheryl Rios, argued that Hillary Clinton should not be president due to hormones potentially making her irrational. However, studies show that male hormones have impaired male leaders' decision-making, and women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks.\n\n2. **Gender Bias**: The bias against women in the workplace is well-established and may hinder a female candidate's chances of being elected. This bias is both overt (e.g., more men named John on corporate boards than women altogether) and covert (e.g., students describing male professors as \"geniuses\" and female professors as \"nice\").\n\n3. **Benefits of Equality**: Equality benefits everyone, leading to better business outcomes, healthier families, and stronger marriages. The passage argues that the U.S. would be stronger if half of the companies were run by women and half of the households were run by men.\n\n4. **Response to Rios**: Rios' statement that she would move to Canada if Clinton is elected is countered by the fact that Canada already had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mistral-Large2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
