Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, accelerated the mapping of the human genome through competitive efforts, leading to both acclaim and criticism. Initially, he faced opposition from the scientific community due to his methods and speed.

After achieving significant milestones, including the first complete genome of Haemophilus influenzae, he founded Celera Genomics to complete the human genome sequencing within three years. Despite initial skepticism, his work led to the publication of the human genome sequence in 2001. Venter's subsequent projects included creating the world's first synthetic life form and conducting extensive oceanographic research.

Half of the victims reported being harassed before the age of 18. The survey highlighted that harassment ranges from insulting behavior to more severe acts like sexual attacks or rape.

The issue is considered \"invisible\" as many incidents go unreported, leading to changes in daily routines and limiting women's freedom. This situation has prompted calls for a campaign to address the issue of sexist or threatening behavior on public transport.
