Poorer youth were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision, and a history of police trouble strongly predicted disengagement from education or employment by 18. Gender disparities were noted, with boys three times more likely to commit violence and girls from poorer areas twice as likely to engage in violent crime. The research, tracking 4,300 Edinburgh youth since 1998, highlights a cycle where poverty and juvenile justice contact reinforce each other, perpetuating violence. Despite Scotland's overall crime decline, deprived areas remain highly affected, with crime concentrated in neighborhoods facing health and unemployment challenges.
