The proposal aims to address the housing crisis by efficiently using social housing stock, reducing the waiting list by around 500,000, and promoting fairness by allowing more families to access housing. However, Labour and critics argue that selling such homes would displace low-income families from neighborhoods, create segregated communities, and worsen the housing crisis, citing previous government cuts to housing programs. The report claims that 21.8% of social housing is expensive, worth more than the regional average, and could raise up to £159bn if sold.

Living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence for both boys and girls, and poorer young people are more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The research also identified that a history of police trouble is a strong predictor of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, while girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to their more affluent peers. The study, which tracked 4,300 young people since 1998, highlights a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can worsen these conditions. Despite overall falling crime rates in Scotland, the most deprived communities continue to experience the highest rates of crime, unemployment, and health problems, raising concerns about whether inequality is being adequately addressed.

His public presentation as a Barcelona player will take place at Camp Nou on Monday.

The ruling allows him to take part in Uruguay's friendlies against Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. His legal team argued that Fifa had misapplied its rules, and while Cas confirmed the sanctions, it acknowledged the need for proportionality in disciplinary actions.

Prime Minister David Cameron has asked First Great Western to review its decision to nearly double fares on the London to Cotswolds route, which passes through his constituency. The fare increase has angered Cameron's constituents, with passengers currently paying £33.30 for an off-peak return to London, which will rise to £62.40, an 87% increase. Train companies can increase unregulated fares three times a year, which make up about half of their revenue. First Great Western claims the change is to align the North Cotswolds route with other services and offers cheaper advanced single tickets. Other sharp price hikes include increases on various routes, with Virgin stating that most of its price hikes affect fares that are at least 20% cheaper than those of rival firms.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-14B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Heavy drinking is defined as consuming more than one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking is defined as consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion. The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, found that the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times that of men nationwide. The increase is attributed to shifting social norms, economic factors, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study also highlights regional variations in drinking rates, with some counties reporting much higher rates than others. The rise in binge drinking has led to increased alcohol-related deaths and costs, with experts noting the need for better public health interventions.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-14B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Van Gaal is familiar with Depay from his inclusion in the 2014 World Cup squad, where he played a key role in Holland's third-place finish. Depay has enjoyed a prolific season at PSV, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games and helping the club win the Eredivisie title for the first time in seven years. Despite interest from clubs like Tottenham and Paris-Saint Germain, United are now in a strong position to sign Depay, with PSV's technical director indicating that the transfer fee will be higher than the £15 million rejected by Tottenham last summer. Depay is regarded as a rising star with potential to rival players like Arjen Robben and Cristiano Ronaldo, though he is still developing his game.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-14B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Previously, they could sell for up to £1.2 million, but now they are being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat and skin.

Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in major cities have further impacted their popularity. The breed's quality has also deteriorated due to excessive cross-breeding for profit, leading to a surplus of poor-quality dogs. Animal welfare workers have rescued some of these dogs, finding them in terrible conditions on their way to slaughterhouses.

The study, which tracked 4,300 young people since 1998, highlights a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can worsen these conditions.

The coroner, Dr. Elizabeth Earland, ruled his death an unlawful killing, citing circumstantial evidence that was deemed overwhelming. His wife, Ganna Ziuzina (also known as Anna), was 19 years younger than him and had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove at the time of the incident. Ziuzina tried to claim his assets shortly after his death, leading to suspicions of her involvement in his death for financial gain. The couple met online in 2006 and married in 2007 after a brief engagement. Ziuzina's background was questioned, as she had initially claimed to be a teacher but was later revealed to have been a lap dancer and stripper. The inquest heard that Ziuzina sold Pring's possessions and moved funds from his account. Although the Ukrainian police initially closed the case, it was reopened in 2011 as a murder inquiry, and the case remains active but not actively pursued. Witnesses described the incident as a deliberate act, and the car involved had stolen license plates and did not stop. Ziuzina did not attend the inquest and stated she had already provided statements to Ukrainian police.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-14B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In her TED Talk, she argues that words like \"fat,\" \"short,\" and \"wife\" are simply honest descriptions of oneself and should not be equated with negativity or ugliness. She highlights the issue of size discrimination, noting a 66% rise in workplace discrimination against larger people over the past 30 years, and how negative body perceptions start at a young age, with many girls wishing to be thinner. However, Lillian offers hope, citing studies that show increased exposure to body diversity leads to greater acceptance of different body types. Through her burlesque performances, she aims to challenge societal beauty standards and promote body positivity. She also shares her personal journey of overcoming insecurity through performing, and her TED Talk, posted on YouTube, has received largely positive feedback, including messages from viewers who felt inspired to reevaluate their body image.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-14B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
