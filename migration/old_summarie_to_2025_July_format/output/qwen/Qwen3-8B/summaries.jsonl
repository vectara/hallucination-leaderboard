The British Geological Survey (BGS) noted that the tremor's location and mechanism were similar to a previous event. The company will review data from the BGS before deciding whether to resume drilling. The BGS explained that injecting pressurized water into rocks during fracking can cause earthquakes. The April tremor was 1.2 miles from the drilling site and occurred at a depth of approximately 2km. The BGS is monitoring fracking as a precaution, and the tremor was felt by at least one person. The BGS also mentioned that the events share a similar location and mechanism. The process has been controversial due to environmental concerns, but the UK's Commons energy select committee suggested that regulation could mitigate these issues.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-8B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Critics, including a homeless group, argue that the relationship between the charity and the company is unethical, as the letting agent profits by placing multiple unrelated individuals in one property and charging housing benefit for each person.

Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK and has been highly profitable, with some properties generating significant annual profits.

This map, which covers 0.4% of the sky, reveals clumps of dark matter and is part of a series that aims to eventually create a 3D view of dark matter across 12.5% of the night sky over five years. The map was made using data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile, and it helps astronomers study galaxy formation and the nature of dark energy. Dark matter, which constitutes about 85% of the universe's matter, cannot be directly observed but can be detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter. The map uses gravitational lensing to show distortions in light caused by dark matter, and it is expected to provide insights into the universe's expansion and the distribution of mass. The project, part of the Dark Energy Survey, is expected to be completed by 2018.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-8B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The report argues this could be the largest social housing building program since the 1970s, potentially reducing the waiting list for social housing by 500,000. However, Labour opposes the plan, claiming it would displace low-income families and worsen the housing crisis. The think tank suggests that selling expensive social housing would create a fairer distribution of housing, with 73% of people, including social tenants, supporting the idea. Critics, including the National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck, warn that the policy could lead to segregation and push lower-income families into poorer areas.

Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime. The study highlights a cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can perpetuate this cycle.

The study considered factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications. The findings suggest there may be discrimination against women in pay raises.

A series of coups, including the 1987 indigenous Fijian coup, the 2000 coup led by George Speight, and the 2006 military takeover, have caused economic harm, particularly to tourism, and damaged Fiji's international reputation.

She also identifies herself with other descriptors like \"short\" and \"wife.\" Lillian argues that the term \"fat\" does not have to equate to \"ugly,\" and she highlights the societal programming that leads women to avoid the term. She notes that size discrimination in the workplace has increased significantly over the past 30 years and that young girls often desire to be thinner. However, Lillian remains hopeful, citing studies that show increased exposure to body diversity can lead to greater acceptance and preference for different body types. Through her burlesque performances, she aims to positively expose audiences to diverse body types. Lillian's first performance was empowering, and she encourages others to find moments of courage to boost self-esteem.
