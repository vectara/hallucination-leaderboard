This decline is partly due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has reduced the practice of giving the dogs as gifts to influence officials' decisions. Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs weighing over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin for leather belts. Animal-welfare workers have rescued groups of the dogs being transported to slaughterhouses, with some in cramped cages and suffering from broken bones. The decline in the Mastiff market has also led to poor-quality dogs being offloaded to abattoirs by unscrupulous breeders.</s>", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Orca-2-13b", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This decline is partly due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has reduced the practice of giving the dogs as gifts to influence officials' decisions. Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs weighing over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin for leather belts. Animal-welfare workers have rescued groups of the dogs being transported to slaughterhouses, with some in cramped cages and suffering from broken bones. The decline in the Mastiff market has also led to poor-quality dogs being offloaded to abattoirs by unscrupulous breeders.</s>", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Orca-2-13b", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
