According to research by Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, the average heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Factors such as more people living alone and the blurring of boundaries between work, home, and personal life have also been proposed as possible explanations for the decline in sexual activity.</s>", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Orca-2-13b", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This decline is partly due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has reduced the practice of giving the dogs as gifts to influence officials' decisions. Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs weighing over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin for leather belts. Animal-welfare workers have rescued groups of the dogs being transported to slaughterhouses, with some in cramped cages and suffering from broken bones. The decline in the Mastiff market has also led to poor-quality dogs being offloaded to abattoirs by unscrupulous breeders.</s>", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Orca-2-13b", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The program involves referring patients to a diagnostic center at the Royal National Hospital for Wales, Llantrisant, within seven days, where six clinics will be held each week. Currently, only 35% of patients with \"peripheral\" symptoms are diagnosed in the Cwm Taf area. The program aims to reach the majority of patients without clear symptoms of the disease. A clinig trial will be established at Port Talbot's Ysbyty Castell-nedd as part of another trial by Swansea Bay NHS Board. The trial was developed during the 12 months that Welsh patients traveled to Aarhus. Denmark established diagnostic centers after realizing the country was lagging in early-stage cancer rates. Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of Cancer Network Wales, says the program will not only change the mindset but also streamline the process. Gareth Jordan, a family doctor in Aberdar, says the pilot program could make a significant difference in patients' lives. If the Cwm Taf pilot program succeeds, health boards in the area will offer the same service in the following months.</s>", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Orca-2-13b", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs weighing over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin for leather belts. Animal-welfare workers have rescued groups of the dogs being transported to slaughterhouses, with some in cramped cages and suffering from broken bones.
