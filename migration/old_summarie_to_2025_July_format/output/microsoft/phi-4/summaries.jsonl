The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics might contribute to the obesity epidemic, similar to their use in farm animals to promote weight gain. Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that children who received antibiotics as infants were more likely to be overweight. Boys, in particular, were prone to weight gain and were slightly taller after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might affect weight by altering gut bacteria, which could increase food absorption and appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy due to potential links to childhood obesity. The passage also notes previous findings that antibiotics in infants are associated with higher risks of eczema and digestive problems, and highlights concerns about antibiotic overuse leading to reduced effectiveness and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The concept involves satellites orbiting Earth, covered in mirrors to harvest sunlight and convert it into laser light, which is then directed to solar panels on Earth to boost their energy reception. Initial trials in Scotland were successful, with plans to move trials to Portugal. The lasers proposed by Dr. Quarterman are not as powerful as those depicted in science fiction, and while there is a potential concern about control, they are not intended for weaponization.

Despite these efforts, NHS trusts are still 10% short of their targets. The cap aims to reduce costs and reliance on agency staff, who are more expensive due to agency fees and employer costs like National Insurance. NHS Improvement plans to publish league tables of trust performance on agency spending and collect data on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust. There are concerns about hospitals being quoted rates significantly above the cap, such as £130 per hour for a surgeon instead of the capped £76.

This research, presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, was conducted by Marie Gardent and colleagues, who produced a new inventory of the French Alps glaciers, assessing around 600 glaciers across several massifs, including Mont Blanc. The study utilized map archives, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual inspection to verify automatic delineation due to issues like debris cover and deep shadows. The findings indicate that glacial retreat is more pronounced in the southern Alps, with the Belledonne and Ecrins Massifs experiencing significant losses, compared to the northern Alps, where conditions such as higher precipitation and cloud cover contribute to slower retreat. The largest French glacier, La Mer de Glace, has seen a slight reduction in area. The research aligns with broader observations of glacial retreat in the Alps, with similar trends reported by Swiss researchers.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics might contribute to the obesity epidemic, similar to their use in farm animals to promote weight gain. Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that children who received antibiotics as infants were more likely to be overweight. Boys, in particular, were prone to weight gain and were slightly taller after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might affect weight by altering gut bacteria, which could increase food absorption and appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy due to potential links to childhood obesity.

This revenue could fund the construction of 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, potentially creating the largest social housing program since the 1970s. The report argues that while social housing would still exist in expensive areas, there would be less of it, aiming to reduce the social housing waiting list by about 500,000 people. The proposal has received backing from Downing Street, which supports councils using their housing stock efficiently. However, Labour opposes the plan, arguing it would displace low-income families and disrupt mixed communities. They propose using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes instead. Critics warn that the policy could lead to the segregation of rich and poor communities. The government, represented by Housing Minister Grant Shapps, supports the sell-off as part of broader reforms to reduce waiting lists and increase affordable housing, with plans to invest £19.5 billion in an affordable housing program.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violent acts. Poorer young people are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision, and household poverty exacerbates the likelihood of offending. The study, part of the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, tracked 4,300 young people since 1998 and was published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal. It highlights a cycle where poverty increases violence risk, and contact with the juvenile justice system further perpetuates these conditions. Despite overall crime reductions in Scotland, areas with chronic crime rates remain in deprived communities.

The findings indicate that glacial retreat is more pronounced in the southern Alps, with the Belledonne and Ecrins Massifs experiencing significant losses, compared to the northern Alps, where conditions such as higher precipitation and cloud cover contribute to slower retreat.

Despite criticism from the scientific community for his approach and lack of modesty, his work significantly accelerated genomic research. After mapping the human genome, Venter focused on creating synthetic life forms, leading to the development of Synthia, published in the journal Science. His early life included a stint as a naval orderly in Vietnam, which inspired his sense of urgency and determination to become a doctor. Venter excelled in research during his medical training and made significant contributions to molecular biology by focusing on RNA to speed up gene sequencing. His departure from the NIH in 1992 led to the founding of The Institute for Genomic Research and later Celera Genomics, which aimed to decode the human genome in three years. Despite facing criticism for his methods, Venter's financial success allowed him to pursue independent research. In 2006, he established the J Craig Venter Institute to create synthetic life forms. Additionally, he conducted oceanic expeditions to sequence microbial genomes, aiming to advance understanding of gene evolution and function.

To enhance security, Apple has implemented a two-step verification system, which requires a four-digit code sent to a trusted device or via the Find My iPhone app after entering a username and password. This measure prevents unauthorized access to iCloud and related services. Users can also use a 14-character recovery key if they lose their trusted device, though concerns exist about its memorability and security. The two-step verification was previously ineffective against data backups accessed via Elcomsoft's software, which is now thwarted by Apple's updates. Experts suggest making two-factor authentication the default for better security, a stance supported by Apple's plans to encourage its use more aggressively. Concerns remain about the potential loss or theft of recovery keys, but some experts downplay these risks.

New figures indicate that a third of men and three-quarters of women have never washed their own car. The study, conducted by vehicle leasing firm OSV, surveyed 1,100 adults and found that only 12% of men who do wash their cars do so regularly. Factors contributing to this decline include shops opening on Sundays, more live football on TV, the rise of hand car washes, and the size of modern vehicles like 4x4s. Despite this trend, car washing increases during holidays, with 15 million cars cleaned during the Easter break. The practice is most common in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least common in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audi, Toyota, and BMW owners are more likely to wash their cars themselves, while Range Rover, Peugeot, and Mercedes owners are less likely to do so. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley notes that the tradition has faded due to time constraints, larger cars, and the availability of alternative car washing options.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He remains uncertain about his return to action for Harlequins, having withdrawn from a match against Saracens. Brown emphasizes the importance of not rushing his recovery to avoid an extended break, similar to those experienced by players like Johnny Sexton and Geoff Parling. He highlights the role of increased awareness of concussion symptoms, gained through world rugby online modules, in his decision to pull out of the England-Ireland game. Brown stresses the importance of honesty and awareness regarding the dangers of concussions. He also mentions his participation in Land Rover's \"We Deal in Real\" campaign, which aims to highlight grassroots rugby clubs.

Research indicates that the frequency of sex among Britons has decreased since the emergence of the internet. Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, notes in his book \"Sex by Numbers\" that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. He attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives, with constant connectivity leading to busier lives and less time for intimate moments. Spiegelhalter also mentions that living alone and competing demands on time, such as work emails, contribute to sex falling lower on the list of priorities. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, supports this by stating that late-night work emails can prevent people from focusing on their partners at bedtime.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once highly prized and capable of commanding prices up to £1.2 million, these dogs, which can weigh up to 80 kg, are now being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat and skin. This decline is partly attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has reduced the practice of gifting these dogs to officials. Additionally, bans on owning large dogs in major cities have impacted their popularity. The collapse of the mastiff market was highlighted when animal-welfare workers rescued dogs being transported to a slaughterhouse, with many already dead or injured. The breed's quality has also suffered due to profit-driven cross-breeding. Urbanization has further contributed to their decline, as people realize Tibetan Mastiffs are not suited for city living. The breed's boom began in 2005, but their status as symbols of wealth has diminished significantly.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-4", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
