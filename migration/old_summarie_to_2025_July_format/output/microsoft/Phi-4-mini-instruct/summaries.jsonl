Boys who had taken antibiotics were also slightly taller.

Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes suggests the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. The research indicates that humans artificially brought together a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, transforming their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees.

However, the study also found that many pupils use tablets for non-academic purposes, such as social media, and that the impact of tablets on academic performance cannot be definitively linked. Despite this, some head teachers reported a positive impact of tablets on student motivation and engagement, and a separate study suggested that touch-screen computers can help boys and poorer pupils learn to read.

The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-old children with records on antibiotic prescription, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Boys who had taken antibiotics were also slightly taller. The study did not prove that antibiotics cause weight gain, but suggested that they may kill gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and increasing appetite. The researchers warned of the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The study also noted that the over-prescription of antibiotics could be contributing to the development of excess weight problems.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The team, which also includes researchers from Exeter, Reading, and SÃ£o Paulo, BelÃ£m universities, found over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest. The function of these sites is still not fully understood, but they are thought to have been used sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes suggests the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. The research indicates that humans artificially brought together a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, transforming their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees. The team likens this to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products, and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Boys who had taken antibiotics were also slightly taller.

Historically, only two First Ladies, Martha Washington and Anna Harrison, did not live in the White House during their husbands' presidencies.

The Obamas moved early to avoid school changes for their daughters. Melania Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, suggesting she may not take on a full-time role like previous First Ladies.

The team, which also includes researchers from Exeter, Reading, and SÃ£o Paulo, BelÃ£m universities, found over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest. The function of these sites is still not fully understood, but they are thought to have been used sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes suggests the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. The research indicates that humans artificially brought together a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, transforming their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees. The team likens this to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products, and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The team, which also includes researchers from Exeter, Reading, and SÃ£o Paulo, BelÃ£m universities, found over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest. The function of these sites is still not fully understood, but they are thought to have been used sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes suggests the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. The research indicates that humans artificially brought together a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, transforming their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees. The team likens this to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products, and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of lines between public and private lives, with people constantly checking emails and being connected to work and the outside world, leading to less time spent with partners.
