Finnish researchers analyzed the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who had received antibiotics as infants, especially boys, had a higher likelihood of being overweight. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by altering gut bacteria, potentially increasing food intake and appetite. The researchers emphasize the need for judicious use of antibiotics in infancy, considering their potential role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic. Previous studies have also linked antibiotic use in babies to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, expressed astonishment at the lack of compensation for the fiasco, especially given the agency's significant profit. Only 2,191 compensation applications were approved, resulting in a total payout of £203,066, with an average compensation of £92.68. The Passport Office's customer complaint database system failure contributed to the low number of approved claims. Ministers rejected a demand for compensation for all affected individuals, citing the potential precedent it could set. Among those denied compensation were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham, who lost nearly £1,500 on a trip to Morocco due to delayed passports. Managers at the agency received up to £3,500 in bonuses during the same period.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-3.5-mini-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The exercise serves as a reminder that some nations, like Britain, cannot conduct anti-submarine warfare alone and will need to address this vulnerability in the upcoming government defense and security review. Russia's increased military strength, with a fleet of around 60 submarines, is also noted, with the country leading in submarine development.

The incident occurred after Phillips and friends, who had insufficient funds to pay for the cab ride, decided to evade the fare. Phillips leapt over a fence in the dark, leading to his fatal fall down a 70ft cliff. The taxi driver, Dave Sidaway, was unaware of the danger due to the darkness. Phillips' body was found the next day by a dog walker. The coroner ruled the death accidental, citing Phillips' disorientation and lack of awareness of the cliff's proximity. Phillips, who worked for Liam Gallagher's clothing label, had grown up in South Wales and studied accountancy at the University of Birmingham.

The research, which compared like-for-like full-time male and female workers, revealed men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked. The study also debunked the theory that women are less likely to ask for raises due to fear of upsetting their boss or deviating from stereotypes. Factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications were considered. The findings suggest some level of discrimination against women in pay negotiations. However, younger women are negotiating their pay more successfully than older females, indicating a potential shift in negotiation behavior.

The researchers suggest the geoglyphs were constructed amidst taller vegetation, making them less visible above the forest canopy. This contrasts with other ritual sites like the Maya pyramids. Soil analysis indicates the Amazonian forests were not pristine but were shaped by humans over 6,000 years, with a focus on economically valuable trees.
