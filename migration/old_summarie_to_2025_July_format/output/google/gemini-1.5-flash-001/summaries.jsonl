The study found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by the age of two, and those who had taken antibiotics as babies were particularly likely to be overweight. The researchers believe that antibiotics may be killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The study also found that repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two increased the odds of being overweight.

This is the PDP's first loss in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, and they also lost control of Adamawa, a state heavily impacted by Boko Haram. The APC's victory is a historic gain, relegating the PDP to a regional party. The PDP's decline is attributed to voter dissatisfaction with their 16-year rule, including allegations of corruption and failure to address the Boko Haram insurgency. The APC's victory in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub, is significant as it marks the first time the president's party has controlled the state since 1999. The PDP will need to rebuild under new leadership, while the APC faces challenges in managing oil-producing states where militant groups could disrupt production.

Liverpool is not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Liverpool's defense was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, Rodgers did not get it right. Liverpool still looks all over the place at the back.

This is the PDP's first loss in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, and they also lost control of Adamawa, a state heavily impacted by Boko Haram. The APC's victory is a historic gain, relegating the PDP to a regional party. The PDP's decline is attributed to voter dissatisfaction with their 16-year rule, including allegations of corruption and failure to address the Boko Haram insurgency. The APC's victory in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub, is significant as it marks the first time the president's party has controlled the state since 1999. The PDP will need to rebuild under new leadership, while the APC faces challenges in managing oil-producing states where militant groups could disrupt production.

Liverpool is not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Liverpool's defense was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, Rodgers did not get it right. Liverpool still looks all over the place at the back.

This is the PDP's first loss in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, and they also lost control of Adamawa, a state heavily impacted by Boko Haram. The APC's victory is a historic gain, relegating the PDP to a regional party. The PDP's decline is attributed to voter dissatisfaction with their 16-year rule, including allegations of corruption and failure to address the Boko Haram insurgency. The APC's victory in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub, is significant as it marks the first time the president's party has controlled the state since 1999. The PDP will need to rebuild under new leadership, while the APC faces challenges in managing oil-producing states where militant groups could disrupt production.

Liverpool is not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes. Liverpool's defense was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, Rodgers did not get it right. Liverpool still looks all over the place at the back.
