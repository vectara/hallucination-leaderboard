Poverty significantly increases the likelihood of violence, particularly among boys (three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls) and girls from poorer households (twice as likely to be involved in violent crime).

These refugees, many of whom were displaced during the partition of India in 1947 and have never visited Pakistan, have been denied basic rights like property ownership and voting. Generations have lived in abject poverty due to this status, stemming from a pre-independence law and a fear of upsetting the state’s demographic balance. Despite this, the recent victory of a Hindu nationalist party in Kashmir offers a glimmer of hope for change, with the party pledging to address the WPRs’ plight.
