This means that GPs refer the patient back and forth for a number of tests, which takes several weeks. Because of this, the fear is that too many patients begin treatment when their cancer has developed or is incurable. Forty doctors in the Cynon Valley who believe something may be wrong will be able to refer the patient to a diagnostic centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days.

Although there was no single incident, he experienced headaches and didn't feel right. He withdrew from Harlequins' match against Saracens and is unsure when he will return.  Brown's caution stems from awareness of the long-term dangers of concussion, highlighted by cases like Johnny Sexton and Geoff Parling, and reinforced by World Rugby's online modules. He previously withdrew from the Ireland match due to concussion symptoms after being knocked out against Italy.  Brown believes increased awareness is crucial and encourages others to prioritize their health.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-1.5-pro-002", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates Britons are having sex less frequently since the rise of the internet, down from five times a month in 1990, to four in 2000, and now three.  This decrease is possibly due to the blurring of lines between public and private life as people constantly check emails, reducing couple’s quiet time together.

Bility cites a FIFA article requiring committee members with conflicts of interest to be replaced and points to Scala's withdrawal from the 2015 election when he shared nationality with then-president Sepp Blatter.  Scala's spokesman argues that shared nationality with a candidate doesn't constitute a conflict of interest, citing FIFA regulations and emphasizing the difference between this election and 2015, where the shared nationality was with the incumbent president. Bility has threatened to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala doesn't withdraw and questions the differing processes between the two elections.  The Liberian FA emphasizes the importance of fairness and integrity in the election following FIFA's recent turmoil.  Bility, previously an electoral candidate himself, has pledged his support to Prince Ali.

A pilot scheme in the Cynon Valley and Neath Port Talbot is focusing on patients whose GPs suspect cancer but who aren't showing any urgent signs or symptoms. This comes a year after doctors visited Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, where the Cwm Taf Health Board officials saw that Denmark’s health service had improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that a patient in Wales who does not have clear symptoms waits too long for a diagnosis because they do not \"easily fit\" into any particular treatment pathway. This means that GPs refer the patient back and forth for a number of tests, which takes several weeks. Because of this, the fear is that too many patients begin treatment when their cancer has developed or is incurable. Forty doctors in the Cynon Valley who believe something may be wrong will be able to refer the patient to a diagnostic centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days. The estimate is that about six patients a week will be seen and will have different tests, and the hope is that this will happen on the same day.

A pilot scheme in the Cynon Valley and Neath Port Talbot is focusing on patients whose GPs suspect cancer but who aren't showing any urgent signs or symptoms. This comes a year after doctors visited Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, where the Cwm Taf Health Board officials saw that Denmark’s health service had improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that a patient in Wales who does not have clear symptoms waits too long for a diagnosis because they do not \"easily fit\" into any particular treatment pathway. This means that GPs refer the patient back and forth for a number of tests, which takes several weeks. Because of this, the fear is that too many patients begin treatment when their cancer has developed or is incurable. Forty doctors in the Cynon Valley who believe something may be wrong will be able to refer the patient to a diagnostic centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days. The estimate is that about six patients a week will be seen and will have different tests, and the hope is that this will happen on the same day.
