It highlights how some, like businesswoman Cheryl Rios, believe a woman’s hormones disqualify her from being president, while others suggest postmenopausal women are *better* suited for the role. The core argument is that despite progress, a significant gender bias persists—both overt and covert—that creates obstacles for women in the workplace and politics. The author argues that equality benefits everyone, boosting economies, families, and teams, and that addressing this bias is crucial for allowing women to reach their full potential.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemma-3-27b-it", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
