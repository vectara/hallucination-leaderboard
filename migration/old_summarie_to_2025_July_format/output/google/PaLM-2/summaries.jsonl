But he can now see a turnaround.\nFianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, is highly critical of how the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is dealing with the midlands, arguing that the half-a-billion euro investment in water meters that won't be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement.\nIts local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area.\nThe government says it is doing its bit for County Longford, with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Parcs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Ballymahon in the county when it opens in 2019.\nHowever, the proposed 200m euro (Â£146m) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission.\nNevertheless, James Bannon, the local Fine Gael TD, is confident the venture will be a success.\nThe Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business.\nSo, the message coming from the midlands is that while it, too, is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\n\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\n\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\n\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\n\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\n\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\n\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\n\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away.

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics.

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\n\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\n\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\n\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\n\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\n\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\n\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\n\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away.

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\n\n- Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\n\n- Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\n\n- What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\n\n- Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\n\n- Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\n\n- Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League.\n\n- Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\n\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\n\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\n\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\n\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\n\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\n\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\n\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away.

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics.

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\n\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\n\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\n\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\n\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\n\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\n\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\n\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away.

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\n\n- Liverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\n\n- Liverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\n\n- What Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\n\n- Liverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\n\n- Whatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\n\n- Playing in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League.\n\n- Saturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "PaLM-2", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
