This research compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records and found that children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were more likely to be overweight.  Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after antibiotics. Researchers suggest antibiotics may cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that would normally consume some food, freeing up more food for the body, or by increasing appetite.  The lead researcher warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy is linked to increased body mass in healthy children and may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic.

Savage predicts Liverpool will struggle against Chelsea in their upcoming match and suggests a lineup for Liverpool.

The retreat has accelerated since then, resulting in a 26% average loss over 40 years.  Glacier retreat is more significant in the southern French Alps, with near disappearance in Belledonne Massif and more retreat in Ecrins Massif compared to Mont Blanc Massif.  This difference is attributed to lower elevations and different climatic conditions in the south.

This decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which stopped the practice of gifting mastiffs to officials, and bans on dogs over 50 kg in several cities. Consequently, these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat to be used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued groups of mastiffs being transported to slaughterhouses, finding them in poor conditions.  The breed's decline is also linked to breeders cross-breeding for profit, resulting in poor quality dogs and oversupply, and the fact that urbanisation has made them less suitable for city living.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The lead researcher warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy is linked to increased body mass in healthy children and may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic.

This inventory used map archives, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual checks to verify satellite data.  A previous inventory from four decades prior found 375 sq km of ice, which decreased to about 340 sq km by 1985-86. The retreat has accelerated since then, resulting in a 26% average loss over 40 years.  Glacier retreat is more significant in the southern French Alps, with near disappearance in Belledonne Massif and more retreat in Ecrins Massif compared to Mont Blanc Massif.  This difference is attributed to lower elevations and different climatic conditions in the south.

Caesareans are more expensive than natural births.  WHO contradicts NHS guidelines which allow caesareans even without medical justification, including for women with tokophobia.
