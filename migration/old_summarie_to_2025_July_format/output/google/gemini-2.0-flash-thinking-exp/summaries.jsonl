This research compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records and found that children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were more likely to be overweight.  Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after antibiotics. Researchers suggest antibiotics may cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that would normally consume some food, freeing up more food for the body, or by increasing appetite.  The lead researcher warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy is linked to increased body mass in healthy children and may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic.

This is the biggest defeat for the PDP since 1999, and follows their loss in the presidential poll last month. The PDP lost key northern states and control of Adamawa, but held on to Rivers State. The APC gained historic wins, especially in the north and Lagos, but did not win any oil-producing states. Elections were marred by violence in some areas, and the APC retained power in Lagos state. The PDP, in power for 16 years, is seen to be in decline due to voter desire for change, defections, corruption allegations, and failure to end the insurgency in the north-east.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Glacier retreat is more significant in the southern French Alps, with near disappearance in Belledonne Massif and more retreat in Ecrins Massif compared to Mont Blanc Massif.

This decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which stopped the practice of gifting mastiffs to officials, and bans on dogs over 50 kg in several cities. Consequently, these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat to be used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued groups of mastiffs being transported to slaughterhouses, finding them in poor conditions.  The breed's decline is also linked to breeders cross-breeding for profit, resulting in poor quality dogs and oversupply, and the fact that urbanisation has made them less suitable for city living.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The lead researcher warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy is linked to increased body mass in healthy children and may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic.

Politicians are hesitant to focus on defence, and manifestos from major parties lack detail on the subject. Despite a more dangerous and unstable world, the UK, like other European nations, has been making significant cuts to its armed forces, reducing army size and naval and air fleets.  UK defence spending has fallen to sixth place globally and is likely to drop below the NATO 2% GDP target, with only smaller parties committed to meeting it.  While further defence cuts are anticipated, some parties are limiting their options due to commitments like Trident replacement.

President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013.

This research, presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, is consistent with glacial retreat in other parts of the Alps. A new French Alps glaciers inventory, created by Marie Gardent and colleagues from the University of Savoie, assessed around 600 glaciers in areas such as Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc Massif.  This inventory used map archives, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual checks to verify satellite data.  A previous inventory from four decades prior found 375 sq km of ice, which decreased to about 340 sq km by 1985-86. The retreat has accelerated since then, resulting in a 26% average loss over 40 years.  Glacier retreat is more significant in the southern French Alps, with near disappearance in Belledonne Massif and more retreat in Ecrins Massif compared to Mont Blanc Massif.  This difference is attributed to lower elevations and different climatic conditions in the south.  The largest French glacier, La Mer de Glace, has decreased slightly from 31.5 sq km to just over 30 sq km since the late 1960s/early 1970s.
