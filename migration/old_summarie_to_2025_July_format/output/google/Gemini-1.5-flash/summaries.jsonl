The researchers believe that antibiotics may be killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, leading to more food being available for the body. They also suggest that killing certain gut bugs may increase appetite. The study highlights the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy, as overuse could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic.", "company": "google", "model_name": "Gemini-1.5-flash", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The DES is a five-year project that aims to map 12.5% of the sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter and dark energy. The map shows clumps of dark matter, with red indicating more dark matter and blue indicating less. The researchers used gravitational lensing to study the distortion of light around distant galaxies caused by the gravitational pull of dark matter. The map shows large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside.

This is the PDP's biggest loss since the end of military rule in 1999, as they also lost the presidential election last month. The APC's victory was particularly strong in the north, including key states like Katsina and Kaduna. However, the PDP managed to hold onto Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub, and won eight governorships in the south-east. The APC's success has relegated the PDP to a regional party, raising concerns for President-elect Muhammadu Buhari as militant groups could disrupt oil production in the five oil-producing states where the APC failed to win. Despite some violence, the elections were generally more peaceful than in previous years, suggesting a maturing democracy in Nigeria. The PDP will need to rebuild under a new leader after 16 years in power, facing accusations of corruption and failing to address the Islamist insurgency in the north-east.", "company": "google", "model_name": "Gemini-1.5-flash", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research shows that the frequency of sex has been declining since the emergence of the internet, with couples having sex three times a month now, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Professor Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life, leading to less time for couples to spend together.
