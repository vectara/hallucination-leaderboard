These discoveries, revealed by modern deforestation, are more than 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" that were previously concealed by rainforest. The function of these sites is little understood, but they are thought to be sporadic ritual gathering places rather than villages or defensive structures. Analysis of soil samples by Dr Neil Loader suggests the geoglyphs were built amongst taller vegetation and likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose. The research also indicates human influence on the Amazonian environment over 6,000 years, suggesting people transformed the forest by concentrating on economically valuable trees (likened to a \"prehistoric supermarket\") rather than burning large areas, and this ancient \"agroforestry\" may have left a legacy on the biodiversity of some remaining forests.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview", "date_code": "04-17", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A 1987 coup overthrew an Indian-dominated government, leading to constitutional changes. A further coup in 2000 involved taking the first ethnic Indian prime minister and others hostage, harming the economy (especially tourism) and international reputation. Rancor over the 2000 coup and divisions over amnesty plans persisted, culminating in a 2006 military takeover, Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth in 2009 but reinstated after agreeing to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Australia and New Zealand to restore diplomatic ties. Fiji's population is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; coups and agitation caused thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee, making indigenous Fijians a small majority. Segregation is deep, and there are small minority communities. The economy relies heavily on sugar and tourism but is diverse, including mining, services, and manufacturing. However, persistent trade and budget deficits make Fiji a large per capita recipient of aid.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview", "date_code": "04-17", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
