' it 's that trust factor . you have to gain that trust , and i think we 're slowly starting to do that , ' combs said . but the future of the scott county program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear . the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller opana , health officials have said . pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy . senate president pro tem david long said on thursday that the emergency exchange for scott county was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long-term . nor was he sure whether the senate would support legislation sponsored by house public health committee chairman ed clere , r-new albany , that would allow the 23 indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis c to establish their own needle-exchange programs . the centers for disease control and prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis c are also infected with hiv . health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential hiv outbreak . the house approved the bill on april 7 in a 54-39 vote , and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on monday in a house-senate conference committee , which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the legislature 's april 29 adjournment deadline . long said pence is n't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it . ' at the same time , you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in , so we 're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us , ' long said . medical waste containers stored in preparation for scott county residents that are looking to exchange used needles . the needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by gov . mike pence in an attempt to curb the state 's largest-ever hiv outbreak . clere said he appreciates pence 's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that ' it does n't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak . it 's just not enough . ' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable . but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . ' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said . money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options . since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs . pence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program . ' they asked the state agencies to find their own money . how sustainable is that ? ' said dr. beth meyerson , co-director of the rural center for aids/std prevention at indiana university . ' there 's no evidence that the pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all .

' it 's that trust factor . you have to gain that trust , and i think we 're slowly starting to do that , ' combs said . but the future of the scott county program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear . the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller opana , health officials have said . pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy . senate president pro tem david long said on thursday that the emergency exchange for scott county was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long-term . nor was he sure whether the senate would support legislation sponsored by house public health committee chairman ed clere , r-new albany , that would allow the 23 indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis c to establish their own needle-exchange programs . the centers for disease control and prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis c are also infected with hiv . health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential hiv outbreak . the house approved the bill on april 7 in a 54-39 vote , and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on monday in a house-senate conference committee , which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the legislature 's april 29 adjournment deadline . long said pence is n't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it . ' at the same time , you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in , so we 're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us , ' long said . medical waste containers stored in preparation for scott county residents that are looking to exchange used needles . the needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by gov . mike pence in an attempt to curb the state 's largest-ever hiv outbreak . clere said he appreciates pence 's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that ' it does n't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak . it 's just not enough . ' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable . but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . ' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said . money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options . since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs . pence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program . ' they asked the state agencies to find their own money . how sustainable is that ? ' said dr. beth meyerson , co-director of the rural center for aids/std prevention at indiana university .
