These emergencies were identified through a survey of 2,000 people, with the top issue being inability to sleep. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity created products, and three were shortlisted:\n1.  **Snooze:** An alarm clock by Instruments that connects to a phone and silences notifications to aid sleep.\n2.  **Forget Me Lock:** A device by Onn Studio that attaches to a key, showing red when locked and green when open, to confirm if the door is locked.\n3.  **Nipper:** Claimed by creators Impulse to be the world's smallest mobile charger, using household batteries for power.\n\nThe public can vote for their favourite prototype on Twitter by retweeting using the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by 46 April will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign and developed into an actual product. Other prototypes that didn't make the shortlist included a cycling helmet with bone conduction headphones, a parking pin alert system, and an app to relay messages when a phone battery dies.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-exp", "date_code": "03-25", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that sexual frequency among Britons has decreased since the emergence of the internet, with typical heterosexual couples now having sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter suggests that increased technological connectivity has blurred the lines between public and private lives, home and work, reducing quiet time as people constantly check emails. This busyness squeezes out time for partners. Researcher Catherine Mercer adds that competing demands lower sex on priority lists, and dealing with work emails late at night hinders the ability to focus on a partner at bedtime.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-exp", "date_code": "03-25", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
