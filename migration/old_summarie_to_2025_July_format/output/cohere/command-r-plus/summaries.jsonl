The study, tracking 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, found that poverty is a significant factor in youth offending and victimization. It also identified a strong link between a history of police involvement and a young person's likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Gender was another powerful predictor, with boys being more prone to violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds facing higher risks of involvement in violent crime. The findings suggest that poverty and contact with the juvenile justice system create a cycle that exacerbates violence and poverty-related risks. Despite Scotland's overall crime rate being at a 41-year low, the benefits of this reduction are not evenly distributed, with deprived communities still experiencing high crime rates and associated issues like chronic health problems and unemployment.

Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed in tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research also challenges previous beliefs about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial spread of various plant species over millennia.

The study, tracking 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, found that poverty is a significant factor in youth offending and victimization. It also identified a strong link between a history of police involvement and a young person's likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Gender was another powerful predictor, with boys being more prone to violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds facing higher risks of involvement in violent crime. The findings suggest that poverty and contact with the juvenile justice system create a cycle that exacerbates violence and poverty-related risks. Despite Scotland's overall crime rate being at a 41-year low, the benefits of this reduction are not evenly distributed, with deprived communities still experiencing high crime rates and associated issues like chronic health problems and unemployment.

Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed in tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research also challenges previous beliefs about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial spread of various plant species over millennia.

The study, tracking 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, found that poverty is a significant factor in youth offending and victimization. It also identified a strong link between a history of police involvement and a young person's likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Gender was another powerful predictor, with boys being more prone to violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds facing higher risks of involvement in violent crime. The findings suggest that poverty and contact with the juvenile justice system create a cycle that exacerbates violence and poverty-related risks. Despite Scotland's overall crime rate being at a 41-year low, the benefits of this reduction are not evenly distributed, with deprived communities still experiencing high crime rates and associated issues like chronic health problems and unemployment.

Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed in tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research also challenges previous beliefs about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial spread of various plant species over millennia.

The study, tracking 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, found that poverty is a significant factor in youth offending and victimization. It also identified a strong link between a history of police involvement and a young person's likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Gender was another powerful predictor, with boys being more prone to violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds facing higher risks of involvement in violent crime. The findings suggest that poverty and contact with the juvenile justice system create a cycle that exacerbates violence and poverty-related risks. Despite Scotland's overall crime rate being at a 41-year low, the benefits of this reduction are not evenly distributed, with deprived communities still experiencing high crime rates and associated issues like chronic health problems and unemployment.

Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed in tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research also challenges previous beliefs about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial spread of various plant species over millennia.
