He also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off.\n\nAfter the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year.\n\nGuffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible.\n\nBut the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty.\n\nBut he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour.

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A verification function is used in Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland to provide clearer information on registration sites. Although there is no evidence to support social media claims of people voting twice, the watchdog takes the issue very seriously and urges individuals with information to contact the police. Labour's Cat Smith stated that voting twice is a serious offence and that resources are needed to prosecute suspected individuals.

It contains a large dining room, a lounge, a state room, and an aeroloft with eight beds. The plane is believed to have cost £400 million.\n\nThe lounge is decorated like a luxury hotel, with comfortable seating and a large TV. The master bedroom has a huge bed, an armchair, and a sofa. The conference room is perfect for meetings in the sky, with its long table and comfortable chairs. The executive room can be used as an office or a guest bedroom. The main suite is decorated with over-the-top decorations and could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel. The dining room is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef. The plane also has a number of areas set aside for guests to relax while watching television. The main state room also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation. The lounge is a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience. Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights.

The guard, who was not identified, was taking up position in his sentry box when he lost his footing and slid sideways. He knocked his bearskin on the side of the box and dropped his rifle. The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying.

The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter.

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades.\n\nHM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year.

The find was considered \"highly significant\" by Environment Minister Albert Jacob, as very little is known about the species. Omura's whale was only first described in scientific journals in 2003, and is believed to be restricted to tropical and subtropical waters. The knowledge gained from this whale will help to improve field identification guides and understand the whale's regional distribution. Omura's whales are typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, and have a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly public display in museums.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The deep reddish color was the result of smoke from wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields, but they quickly grew out of control due to strong winds. The smoke from the fires was carried across the Pacific Ocean by atmospheric winds and brought to the Pacific Northwest. The smoke particles filtered out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight, leaving only the red and orange colors to penetrate the air. This is why the sunset was so intense. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will improve and the sunset will lose its reddish hue.\n\n**The wildfires in Siberia**\n\nThe wildfires in Siberia are a major environmental disaster. They have been burning for months and have destroyed millions of acres of forest. The fires are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is contributing to climate change. The fires are also causing air pollution problems in the region.\n\n**The impact of the wildfires on the environment**\n\nThe wildfires in Siberia are having a devastating impact on the environment. The fires are destroying forests, which are important for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The fires are forcing people to evacuate their homes and are causing health problems due to the smoke. The fires are also disrupting the economy of the region.\n\n**The response to the wildfires**\n\nThe Russian government is working to contain the wildfires in Siberia. They have deployed firefighters and aircraft to the region. They are also working to provide assistance to people who have been displaced by the fires.\n\n**The future of the wildfires**\n\nThe wildfires in Siberia are likely to continue for some time.

The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21.\n\nGraham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission.\n\n'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.'\n\nOnly 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.\n\n'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.'\n\nA draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason.\n\n'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'\n\nThe letter concludes by urging the Premier League to 'work with the FA to ensure that these proposals are implemented as soon as possible'.\n\nThe Premier League has said it will consider the proposals, but has not yet made a decision on whether to support them.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

{"article_id": 40, "summary_uid": "f22bfb87a5f45d0cc03fc0c3ffdcc427", "summary": "Nathan Hughes's three-match ban for accidentally knocking out George North was overturned on appeal on Friday night. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The NAC has never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. \n\nAs for the fighters, Mayweather is 40 years old, has not knocked anyone out in 10 years, but is known as one of the smartest fighters in the ring. McGregor is 29, taller, and longer than Mayweather, with a granite-like chin, and has knocked down his UFC rival Nate Diaz multiple times in the past.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008.\n\nThe 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home.\n\nIn addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The guard, who was not identified, was taking up position in his sentry box when he lost his footing and slid sideways. He knocked his bearskin on the side of the box and dropped his rifle. The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades.\n\nHM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Owning and travelling on a private jet is an indulgence restricted to the very wealthiest individuals, with landing fees costing thousands of dollars each time. The busiest times are unsurprisingly during large sporting events, such as the American Superbowl or the Monaco Grand Prix. This is especially true when these events are hosted in smaller cities, increasing the demand for private jets. For example, during the Superbowl this year, PrivateFly (a private jet charter company) estimated the cost of travelling by medium jet from New York to Glendale at $ 38,000 return, or $ 54,000 for a long-range jet. The richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the 767-400 aircraft, and surprisingly, three of the top ten are in Japan. Haneda airport, Tokyo, charges £4,559, or $6,850, to land a private jet, welcoming almost 69 million passengers a year, with a high punctuality rating. Tokyo's other airport, Narita International, charges £3,728, or $5,600 and comes second on the list, while Kansai International, Osaka, charges £3,594, or $5,400. The UK features just once in the top 10 list with Bristol airport charging £2,929, or $4,400. The only US airport to make the list is LaGuardia in New York, which charges $3,950, or £2,630, and Dublin airport comes in eighth place, charging £2,729, or $4,100.

It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.'\n\nOnly 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.\n\n'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.'\n\nA draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches.

{"article_id": 40, "summary_uid": "f22bfb87a5f45d0cc03fc0c3ffdcc427", "summary": "Nathan Hughes's three-match ban for accidentally knocking out George North was overturned on appeal on Friday night. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades.\n\nHM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Here is a concise summary of the passage:\n\nThe UK has been making significant cuts to its armed forces, and the size of the regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relies on its NATO allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. The UK has fallen to sixth place in defence spending, and it is likely that the UK will fall below the NATO threshold. The majority of political parties are not making any firm commitments to defence spending, and the military top brass are planning based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget. There are capability gaps in the UK's military, and the Liberal Democrats and the SNP would scrap the nuclear deterrent. The Conservatives are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement, but Labour and the SNP would look at whether the deterrent can be done with fewer submarines.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off.\n\nAfter the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June.

The rifle was inside a hard rifle case and was secured to a truck safe with padlocks and chains. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the theft. Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit to Utah earlier this month, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool.

This rapid timeline has drawn criticism from some fans, who have pointed out that it is unrealistic for a woman to go from barely showing to giving birth in such a short space of time. Others have defended the show, saying that it is a historical drama and that pregnancy timelines were often compressed in period dramas.\n\nThe show's creator, Debbie Horsfield, has said that she wanted to reflect the reality of childbirth in the 18th century, when women often had to give birth at home with little or no medical assistance. She said that she did not want to make the pregnancy too drawn-out, as she felt that would be unrealistic.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the show's decision to compress the pregnancy timeline, there is no doubt that Demelza's labor and delivery will be a dramatic moment in the series.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time.

He also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off.\n\nAfter the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year.\n\nGuffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible.\n\nBut the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty.\n\nBut he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.'\n\nPaul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.'\n\nHe was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission.\n\n'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.'\n\nOnly 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.\n\n'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.'\n\nA draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches.

'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'\n\nThe letter concludes by urging the Premier League to 'work with the FA to ensure that these proposals are implemented as soon as possible'.\n\nThe Premier League has said it will consider the proposals, but has not yet made a decision on whether to support them.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover agency fees and employer costs when it buys them in. NHS Improvement has said the progress is promising, but that it still leaves the NHS short.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying.

The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots.

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham.

The smoke from the fires was carried across the Pacific Ocean by atmospheric winds and brought to the Pacific Northwest. The smoke particles filtered out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight, leaving only the red and orange colors to penetrate the air. This is why the sunset was so intense. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will improve and the sunset will lose its reddish hue.\n\n**The wildfires in Siberia**\n\nThe wildfires in Siberia are a major environmental disaster.

I think he found a solution at the right time,\" the Arsenal manager said.\n\n\"They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.\"", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21.\n\nGraham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission.\n\n'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.'\n\nOnly 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.\n\n'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.'\n\nA draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason.\n\n'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'\n\nThe letter concludes by urging the Premier League to 'work with the FA to ensure that these proposals are implemented as soon as possible'.\n\nThe Premier League has said it will consider the proposals, but has not yet made a decision on whether to support them.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

{"article_id": 40, "summary_uid": "f22bfb87a5f45d0cc03fc0c3ffdcc427", "summary": "Nathan Hughes's three-match ban for accidentally knocking out George North was overturned on appeal on Friday night. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue.

This shifts the power from Planning Service, a Stormont agency, to local councils. This is seen as a positive move towards democracy by some, including Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE. He argues that it offers local councils the opportunity to develop community and development plans. \n\nOthers are not so optimistic. There are concerns that a strict code of conduct will need to be enforced in order to ensure the handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent. There are also worries that the move could lead to a repeat of the 1960s, when local councils were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing. Friends of the Earth argue that greater transparency is needed in terms of political donations. Others oppose the move as they believe it will deter donors. \n\nOverall, there is both optimism and caution about the planned changes to the planning system in Northern Ireland.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker.\n\nHenry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine.

The guard, who was not identified, was taking up position in his sentry box when he lost his footing and slid sideways. He knocked his bearskin on the side of the box and dropped his rifle. The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers.

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades.\n\nHM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "Cohere-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The busiest times are unsurprisingly during large sporting events, such as the American Superbowl or the Monaco Grand Prix. This is especially true when these events are hosted in smaller cities, increasing the demand for private jets. For example, during the Superbowl this year, PrivateFly (a private jet charter company) estimated the cost of travelling by medium jet from New York to Glendale at $ 38,000 return, or $ 54,000 for a long-range jet. The richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the 767-400 aircraft, and surprisingly, three of the top ten are in Japan. Haneda airport, Tokyo, charges £4,559, or $6,850, to land a private jet, welcoming almost 69 million passengers a year, with a high punctuality rating. Tokyo's other airport, Narita International, charges £3,728, or $5,600 and comes second on the list, while Kansai International, Osaka, charges £3,594, or $5,400.
