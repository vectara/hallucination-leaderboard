Scientists at Oregon State University, who conducted the whale-tracking study, found Varvara's route and stops at three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales surprising. This suggests that some western gray whales might actually be eastern grays.

The landmass, rising up to 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000-1,640ft long and 100ft wide. Geologists attribute the phenomenon to a nearby landslide caused by melting ice and snow, which dropped a section of land, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Local residents reported no sounds or tremors to indicate the movement. Authorities do not expect the landmass to expand further and believe it is unrelated to the recent 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Kathmandu.
