The investigation focused on ditched enclosures, now revealed due to modern deforestation, which were previously hidden by rainforest. Over 450 large geometrical structures, known as \"geoglyphs,\" were found. The purpose of these sites is still a mystery, but they are not believed to be villages or defensive structures due to the lack of artefacts and their layout. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were constructed within tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research challenges previous assumptions about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial gathering of diverse plant species over millennia.

The leaks revealed the National Security Agency's (NSA) access to various personal data, including chat logs, stored data, and social media activity.

The NSA's director defended the surveillance, citing national security, but experts questioned its scope and effectiveness.

This global surveillance program, Prism, raised concerns about user privacy and the potential violation of data protection laws. The US Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act provide legal grounds for US authorities to access non-American data stored in the US. The EU expressed concern, seeking more information, while the UK's involvement remains unclear.

Research indicates that Britons are having less sex compared to previous decades, with the average heterosexual couple now engaging in sexual activity three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. The professor attributes this decline to the blurring of boundaries between public and private lives due to technology, resulting in busier schedules and less time for intimacy. The constant checking of emails and the erosion of work-life balance are cited as potential reasons for this trend.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The investigation focused on ditched enclosures, now revealed due to modern deforestation, which were previously hidden by rainforest. Over 450 large geometrical structures, known as \"geoglyphs,\" were found. The purpose of these sites is still a mystery, but they are not believed to be villages or defensive structures due to the lack of artefacts and their layout. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were constructed within tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research challenges previous assumptions about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial gathering of diverse plant species over millennia. The team compares the ancient practices to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" and suggests that modern biodiversity in the region may still reflect these early agroforestry techniques.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This marks a major setback for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which has dominated Nigerian politics since 1999. The PDP's decline is evident in its loss of key northern states and its failure to secure control in areas affected by Boko Haram's insurgency. The APC's success relegates the PDP to a regional party, primarily in the south-east and Niger Delta. However, the APC's inability to win in oil-producing states may pose challenges for President-elect Muhammadu Buhari in addressing militant groups and securing oil revenue. The elections were generally more peaceful than previous years, but violence and ethnic tensions persisted in some areas. The PDP's defeat can be attributed to voters' desire for change after 16 years, defections to the APC, and allegations of corruption and inadequate response to the Islamist insurgency.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This move comes as Chipotle aims to capitalize on the growing demand for food delivery, estimated to be a $70 billion market. Customers will incur a nine per cent service charge, in addition to delivery fees starting at $5, for the convenience of having burritos and other menu items delivered to their homes. Chipotle's decision to collaborate with Postmates, which operates similarly to Uber with independent contractors, follows the company's previous rejections of similar offers from other third-party delivery services. The restaurant's popularity is highlighted by recent visits from presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton, who were spotted at Chipotle locations. Other major food chains, such as Starbucks, Taco Bell, McDonald's, and Burger King, are also exploring or have already launched their own delivery services to compete in this expanding market.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The erosion of boundaries between work and personal life, due to constant email checking, leaves less time for intimacy. This trend is supported by researcher Catherine Mercer, who notes that competing demands on time lead to sex becoming a lower priority.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Mighty's report claims that Olam creates a market for palm oil from unknown sources, potentially encouraging rogue traders. Olam denies these allegations, stating they have strict sourcing policies against burning and deforestation. The company has a small market share and buys mostly from third-party suppliers, making supplier policing challenging. Temasek, as Olam's majority stakeholder, could be indirectly connected to these practices. The palm oil industry is massive and often criticized for labour issues and environmental damage, with debates between green groups and executives on responsibility.

The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, attributes this to changing social norms, particularly regarding women's drinking habits. Binge drinking rates rose faster for women than men, with a 36% increase in Santa Clara County, California, compared to 23% for men. The study also highlights the economic and cultural factors contributing to this trend, including the influx of wealthy professionals in certain cities, the relative affordability of alcohol, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol control policies. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of alcohol consumers has remained stable. The study's findings are concerning, as excessive drinking has severe health and economic consequences, with an estimated 88,600 U.S. deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an annual cost of over $220 billion.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The WHO's statement contradicts NHS guidelines, which allow women to choose caesareans even without medical reasons, including cases of tokophobia (fear of childbirth).
