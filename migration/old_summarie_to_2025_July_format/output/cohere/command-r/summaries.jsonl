The text also explores the role of the First Lady, which is ceremonial and often involves supporting causes, and how previous First Ladies have balanced their duties with family life. It mentions that Melania Trump's focus on Barron suggests a different approach to the role compared to predecessors like Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, and speculates about Ivanka Trump's potential involvement.

The investigation focused on ditched enclosures, now revealed due to modern deforestation, which were previously hidden by rainforest. Over 450 large geometrical structures, known as \"geoglyphs,\" were found. The purpose of these sites is still a mystery, but they are not believed to be villages or defensive structures due to the lack of artefacts and their layout. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were constructed within tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research challenges previous assumptions about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial gathering of diverse plant species over millennia.

The erosion of boundaries between work and personal life, due to constant email checking, leaves less time for intimacy.

Mighty's report claims that Olam creates a market for palm oil from unknown sources, potentially encouraging rogue traders. Olam denies these allegations, stating they have strict sourcing policies against burning and deforestation. The company has a small market share and buys mostly from third-party suppliers, making supplier policing challenging. Temasek, as Olam's majority stakeholder, could be indirectly connected to these practices. The palm oil industry is massive and often criticized for labour issues and environmental damage, with debates between green groups and executives on responsibility.

The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, attributes this to changing social norms, particularly regarding women's drinking habits. Binge drinking rates rose faster for women than men, with a 36% increase in Santa Clara County, California, compared to 23% for men. The study also highlights the economic and cultural factors contributing to this trend, including the influx of wealthy professionals in certain cities, the relative affordability of alcohol, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol control policies. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of alcohol consumers has remained stable. The study's findings are concerning, as excessive drinking has severe health and economic consequences, with an estimated 88,600 U.S. deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an annual cost of over $220 billion.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The WHO's statement contradicts NHS guidelines, which allow women to choose caesareans even without medical reasons, including cases of tokophobia (fear of childbirth).

Over 450 large geometrical structures, known as \"geoglyphs,\" were found. The purpose of these sites is still a mystery, but they are not believed to be villages or defensive structures due to the lack of artefacts and their layout. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were constructed within tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy.

The historical context of the 1960s housing discrimination and the Civil Rights movement adds to these concerns, with James Orr warning against a repeat of past issues.

It was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a powerful imaging device, and by studying the shapes of galaxies. Dark matter's presence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter, allowing astronomers to study galaxy formation and test cosmological theories. The map reveals large filaments of dark matter along which galaxies are formed, and the project aims to map 12.5% of the sky by 2018.", "company": "cohere", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
