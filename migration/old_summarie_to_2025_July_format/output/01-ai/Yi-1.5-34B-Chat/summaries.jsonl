Children who took antibiotics as babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two raised the odds of being a fat toddler.

Stiviano, and his wife Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling. Shelly Sterling sued V. Stiviano, claiming that Donald had used the couple's money to buy her expensive gifts, including luxury cars and a duplex. V. Stiviano argued that there was nothing wrong with receiving these gifts. A Los Angeles judge ruled in Shelly Sterling's favor, ordering V. Stiviano to pay back over $2.6 million. The decision was considered a victory for the Sterling family and set a precedent for injured spouses to recover damages from the recipients of such gifts. The case gained notoriety after an audio recording surfaced of Donald Sterling making racist remarks against African-Americans, which led to his ban from the NBA, a $2.5 million fine, and the termination of his ownership rights in the franchise.", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-34B-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The increase in women's drinking habits is attributed to changing social norms. The study also highlights that 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012. Approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, with the cost of excessive drinking estimated at more than $220 billion per year.

Research indicates that Britons are having sex less often since the emergence of the internet, with a typical heterosexual couple now having sex three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, attributes this decline to the increasing integration of public and private lives, constant email checking, and a busier lifestyle due to better technological connections. Factors such as more people living alone and competing demands on time, including handling work emails late at night, have also played a role in reducing the priority of sex in people's lives.", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-34B-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The dogs' decline is partly due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, as wealthy businessmen previously gave the dogs to officials as gifts to influence decisions. Bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have also impacted the breed's popularity. Animal welfare workers have rescued groups of these dogs en route to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used for hotpot and their skin for leather belts. The poor treatment of these dogs is believed to be widespread across China, with some being stolen from the streets or sold by unscrupulous breeders. The decline in the quality of the breed is attributed to cross-breeding for profit. Additionally, urbanization has made Tibetan Mastiffs less suitable for city living, and their boom in popularity began in 2005, with one puppy selling for £1.2 million.", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-34B-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Apple utilizes MCF for its AirDrop feature, and Firechat's messages are sent securely, with users able to send messages anonymously. Greenstone, an egg-shaped gadget, acts as a beacon or booster to extend the range of these mesh networks, overcoming the typical 200 feet limit. It is designed to improve communication in communities, neighborhoods, hospitals, or crowded events where traditional networks may fail. Currently, Greenstone works with Firechat at a range of about 20 feet and can store up to 1,000 recent messages.

To achieve this, Airbus and OneWeb have developed new assembly line methods to manufacture satellites at a higher volume and lower cost. The first 10 satellites are set to launch in April next year, with more to follow. The constellation's establishment requires an extensive rocket campaign, with over 20 Soyuz vehicles planned to deploy satellites into orbit. OneWeb and Airbus are part of a growing number of companies planning a mega-constellation, but they believe their concept has a first-mover advantage. The UK Space Agency plays a significant role in the project, and there is a focus on mitigating space debris, with plans to de-orbit old, redundant spacecraft within five years.

Elizabeth Mitchell, of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, states that children born with the syndrome do not get better and that the problem is vastly under-diagnosed. Pregnant women are advised by the government not to drink alcohol, but if they do, the recommended maximum consumption is up to two units no more than twice a week.

Half of these women were assaulted before turning 18. The poll revealed that all female users of mass transit had been victims of gender harassment or sexual assault, with some being unaware of this due to societal conditioning. The survey found a range of harassment incidents, from low-level abuse to sex attacks or rape. As a result, six out of ten women feared being attacked on public transport, compared to three out of ten men. This issue is often unreported and leads to restrictions on women's freedom, as they must alter their daily lives to avoid confrontation. The High Council for Gender Equality compiled a report on this issue, calling for a campaign to address sexist or threatening behavior on buses and trains. The passage emphasizes the need for women to be able to move freely in public spaces without fear and for better education on recognizing and reporting sexual assault.", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-34B-Chat", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
