Additionally, a history of police involvement is the strongest predictor of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18, and poorer youth are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision.\n\nThe study, published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal and funded by various organizations, highlighted a \"destructive dynamic\" where poverty and justice system contact perpetuate violence.

They share data with Ukraine's security service, which reportedly uses it for analysis, though officials deny directing artillery based on it.\n\n- **Cyber Berkut**, an anti-Western group, aims to thwart Ukraine's military actions by hacking government websites (e.g., during Joe Biden's visit to display anti-U.S. messages), retrieving confidential documents on U.S. aid, manipulating billboards with graphic content accusing Ukrainian officials of war crimes, disrupting elections, leaking military data, and spreading unverified claims about Ukraine downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\n\n- **Anonymous International** (also known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay), focuses on Russian affairs but covers Ukraine, publishing leaked Kremlin documents, such as letters from Russian fighters and emails from a rebel commander like Igor Girkin.

Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney criticizes the UK government's spending review for placing \"unprecedented pressure\" on Scotland's public expenditure, arguing that cuts since 2010 will reduce Scotland's discretionary budget by 12.5% in real terms by 2019-20, with 4.2% of that occurring between now and then. He highlights that the Chancellor, George Osborne, has imposed annual real-terms cuts until 2020, totaling over £1bn still to come, and asserts that debt reduction could have been achieved without such measures. Swinney emphasizes the Scottish government's commitment to protecting priorities like schools, hospitals, and police, citing achievements such as more police, lower crime, better schools, free tuition, and a record health budget.\n\nIn response, a UK government spokesman counters that Scotland will receive £390m more in spending next year (rising to £750m with underspends), with a block grant of nearly £30bn, and suggests this is preferable to alternatives like independence amid low oil prices. They urge the Scottish government to focus on new powers rather than complaints.\n\nLabour's Jackie Baillie criticizes Swinney for insufficient anti-austerity action, calling for a long-term budget and real alternatives, including different tax decisions from both the Tories and SNP.", "company": "xai", "model_name": "grok-3-mini-latest", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It notes that Britain may need to grant EU-registered boats access to UK waters as part of a broader deal, despite fishing communities' strong support for leaving the EU, which stemmed from dissatisfaction with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP, criticized for quotas and equal access that harmed British interests, led many in the industry to back Brexit in hopes of regaining control over UK waters and becoming a major fish exporter, similar to Norway.\n\nHowever, a House of Lords report warns that the industry—contributing just 0.5% of GDP and employing 12,000 fishers—could be sidelined in negotiations due to shared waters with EU states, heavy reliance on EU exports, and the need for tariff-free market access. Trade-offs might involve concessions on fishing rights. The report recommends retaining key CFP elements, such as science-based quotas and international cooperation, while addressing the risk of fragmented management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite concerns, industry leaders express optimism, citing recent EU quota increases for species like plaice and haddock as positive signs.

By 1985-86, coverage had already dropped to about 340 sq km, with acceleration in retreat noted since then.\n\nRetreat varies across regions, with the greatest losses in the southern Alps (e.g., near-total disappearance in Belledonne Massif and over three times more retreat in Ecrins than in Mont Blanc).

They share data with Ukraine's security service, which reportedly uses it for analysis, though officials deny directing artillery based on it.\n\n- **Cyber Berkut**, an anti-Western group, aims to thwart Ukraine's military actions by hacking government websites (e.g., during Joe Biden's visit to display anti-U.S. messages), retrieving confidential documents on U.S. aid, manipulating billboards with graphic content accusing Ukrainian officials of war crimes, disrupting elections, leaking military data, and spreading unverified claims about Ukraine downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\n\n- **Anonymous International** (also known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay), focuses on Russian affairs but covers Ukraine, publishing leaked Kremlin documents, such as letters from Russian fighters and emails from a rebel commander like Igor Girkin. It is unclear if they hack or receive materials from insiders, and their website is blocked in Russia.\n\nThe passage, from BBC Monitoring, highlights these independent activist groups' roles in the conflict, with pro-Ukrainian and anti-Western motivations.", "company": "xai", "model_name": "grok-3-mini-latest", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It notes that Britain may need to grant EU-registered boats access to UK waters as part of a broader deal, despite fishing communities' strong support for leaving the EU, which stemmed from dissatisfaction with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP, criticized for quotas and equal access that harmed British interests, led many in the industry to back Brexit in hopes of regaining control over UK waters and becoming a major fish exporter, similar to Norway.\n\nHowever, a House of Lords report warns that the industry—contributing just 0.5% of GDP and employing 12,000 fishers—could be sidelined in negotiations due to shared waters with EU states, heavy reliance on EU exports, and the need for tariff-free market access. Trade-offs might involve concessions on fishing rights. The report recommends retaining key CFP elements, such as science-based quotas and international cooperation, while addressing the risk of fragmented management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite concerns, industry leaders express optimism, citing recent EU quota increases for species like plaice and haddock as positive signs.

By 1985-86, coverage had already dropped to about 340 sq km, with acceleration in retreat noted since then.\n\nRetreat varies across regions, with the greatest losses in the southern Alps (e.g., near-total disappearance in Belledonne Massif and over three times more retreat in Ecrins than in Mont Blanc). Factors include lower elevations and less precipitation in the south, while the north, including the largest glacier La Mer de Glace (now just over 30 sq km, slightly smaller than in the 1960s/1970s), experiences less retreat due to higher elevation and more cloud cover.

This made him wealthy and independent, allowing him to fund his own work.\n\nIn 2006, he formed the J.
