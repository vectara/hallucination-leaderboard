Over the years, it was known for its vibrant social scene with numerous pubs and bars. However, with technological advancements and the move of major newspapers like those owned by Rupert Murdoch to Wapping in 1986, Fleet Street's role diminished. By 1988, most newspapers had relocated, leaving behind buildings repurposed for other uses.

Analysis of soil samples by Dr Loader suggests these geoglyphs were built in taller vegetation, not visible from above the forest canopy. The research challenges the notion of the Amazon as a pristine ecosystem before European arrival, indicating human influence over 6,000 years through selective planting of valuable trees, akin to a \"prehistoric supermarket\".

This decline has been observed since the internet's emergence. The integration of public and private life due to technology, constant email checking, and the busyness of modern life are cited as reasons for this decrease. Additionally, the blending of work, home, and social life leaves less time for intimacy, with experts noting that competing demands on time lower the priority of sex.", "company": "xai", "model_name": "grok-2-vision-1212", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This has led to a decline in their market, with many being sent to slaughterhouses where their meat is used in hotpots and their skins for leather. Animal welfare issues have arisen, with reports of mastiffs being transported in poor conditions, some dying en route. The breed's quality has deteriorated due to profit-driven cross-breeding, leading to an oversupply of poor-quality dogs. Urbanization has also highlighted that these dogs are not suited for city life. Previously seen as status symbols, their popularity peaked in 2005, with one puppy fetching \u00a31.2 million just 13 months ago.", "company": "xai", "model_name": "grok-2-vision-1212", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
