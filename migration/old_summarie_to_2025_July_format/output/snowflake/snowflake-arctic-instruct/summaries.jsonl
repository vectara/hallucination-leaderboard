The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records on antibiotic prescription and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, thus freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The scheme was inspired by a visit to Denmark, which has improved its cancer survival rates. The concern is that some patients in Wales with unclear symptoms may have to wait too long for diagnosis, leading to delayed treatment. The hope is that the pilot will help reduce waiting times and improve early detection. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. The project was developed over 12 months by Welsh experts returning from Aarhus. Denmark's success in establishing diagnostic centers prompted concerns about Wales' position regarding cancer survival rates. Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of the Wales Cancer Network, believes the plan will alleviate patient anxiety and speed up the process. If successful, the pilot could make a significant difference in patients' lives and lead to faster diagnoses.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A study shows that this procedure cuts the risk of dying from breast cancer by over 60%. Women with a mutated version of BRCA1 or another gene called BRCA2 face a lifetime risk of breast cancer up to 70%, and they also have a high risk of ovarian tumors. The study found a significant drop in breast cancer death in women with a BRCA1 mutation who had an oophorectomy, but not in those with a BRCA2 mutation. Oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis, and for the 70 BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years, there was a 73% reduction in death compared to women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure. The authors suggest that oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancers.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research has shown that the frequency of sex among Britons has decreased since the emergence of the internet, with a typical heterosexual couple now having sex three times a month, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Professor David Spiegelhalter suggests that the integration of public and private lives, as well as busier lives due to better technological connectivity, are contributing factors to this decline.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

As a result, Tibetan Mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses and their meat used in cheap hotpots.

This issue limits women's freedom as they often have to change their routes, modes of transportation, schedules, attitudes, and clothing to avoid confrontation.

A study shows that this procedure cuts the risk of dying from breast cancer by over 60%. Women with a mutated version of BRCA1 or another gene called BRCA2 face a lifetime risk of breast cancer up to 70%, and they also have a high risk of ovarian tumors. The study found a significant drop in breast cancer death in women with a BRCA1 mutation who had an oophorectomy, but not in those with a BRCA2 mutation. Oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis, and for the 70 BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years, there was a 73% reduction in death compared to women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure. The authors suggest that oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancers.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
