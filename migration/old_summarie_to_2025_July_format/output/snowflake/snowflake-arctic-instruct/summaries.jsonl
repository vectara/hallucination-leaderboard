The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records on antibiotic prescription and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, thus freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study found a significant drop in breast cancer death in women with a BRCA1 mutation who had an oophorectomy, but not in those with a BRCA2 mutation. Oophorectomies were performed an average of six years after breast cancer diagnosis, and for the 70 BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years, there was a 73% reduction in death compared to women with the mutation who never underwent the procedure. The authors suggest that oophorectomy should become part of the treatment discussion at the time of diagnosis for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancers.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
