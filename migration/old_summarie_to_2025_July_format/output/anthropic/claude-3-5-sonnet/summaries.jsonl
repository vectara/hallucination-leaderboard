The research, published in Pediatrics, examined over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese, with those who received early antibiotics showing a particular tendency toward weight gain. Boys appeared more susceptible to this effect and were slightly taller than those who hadn't received antibiotics.\n\nWhile the study didn't establish causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally process food, leaving more calories available for absorption. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital emphasized that this effect could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant given current childhood obesity rates, with one-third of 10-11 year olds and over one-fifth of 4-5 year olds in England being overweight or obese.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, published in Pediatrics, examined over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese, with those who received early antibiotics showing a particular tendency toward weight gain. Boys appeared more susceptible to this effect and were slightly taller than those who hadn't received antibiotics.\n\nWhile the study didn't establish causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally process food, leaving more calories available for absorption. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital emphasized that this effect could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant given current childhood obesity rates, with one-third of 10-11 year olds and over one-fifth of 4-5 year olds in England being overweight or obese.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, published in Pediatrics, examined over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese, with those who received early antibiotics showing a particular tendency toward weight gain. Boys appeared more susceptible to this effect and were slightly taller than those who hadn't received antibiotics.\n\nWhile the study didn't establish causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally process food, leaving more calories available for absorption. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital emphasized that this effect could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant given current childhood obesity rates, with one-third of 10-11 year olds and over one-fifth of 4-5 year olds in England being overweight or obese.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The report argues that Russia, under President Putin's direction, was directly involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, despite official Russian denials. Key findings include:\n\n1. Russian soldiers and equipment were crucial in major rebel victories in Donetsk and Luhansk\n2. Russian generals, not separatists, directed main battles\n3. Russian volunteers were paid $2,000-3,000 monthly\n4. The conflict cost Russia approximately 53bn roubles\n\nThe report faced publication challenges with only 2,000 initial copies printed, as publishers were hesitant to handle the material. While some Russians accept their country's involvement in Ukraine, the opposition claims Putin orchestrated the war to boost his popularity.

The University of Manchester team, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, analyzed 130 million telescope images to create the map, which shows how dark matter corresponds to galaxy formation.

By age two, 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese, with those who received early antibiotics showing a particular tendency toward weight gain. Boys appeared more susceptible to this effect and were slightly taller than those who hadn't received antibiotics.\n\nWhile the study didn't establish causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally process food, leaving more calories available for absorption. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital emphasized that this effect could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant given current childhood obesity rates, with one-third of 10-11 year olds and over one-fifth of 4-5 year olds in England being overweight or obese.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The report argues that Russia, under President Putin's direction, was directly involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, despite official Russian denials. Key findings include:\n\n1. Russian soldiers and equipment were crucial in major rebel victories in Donetsk and Luhansk\n2. Russian generals, not separatists, directed main battles\n3. Russian volunteers were paid $2,000-3,000 monthly\n4. The conflict cost Russia approximately 53bn roubles\n\nThe report faced publication challenges with only 2,000 initial copies printed, as publishers were hesitant to handle the material. While some Russians accept their country's involvement in Ukraine, the opposition claims Putin orchestrated the war to boost his popularity.

The University of Manchester team, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, analyzed 130 million telescope images to create the map, which shows how dark matter corresponds to galaxy formation.
