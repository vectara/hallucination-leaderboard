Researchers theorize antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume food, making more calories available for absorption or potentially increasing appetite.\n\nDr. Antti Saari, the lead author, warns this effect could contribute to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and emphasizes the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy.

Despite residing in India for generations, approximately 100,000 Hindu refugees remain unable to own property or vote in state elections, effectively making them second-class citizens.\n\nThe article focuses on 82-year-old Mangu Ram, who fled violence at age 14 and still lives in poverty in a slum near Jammu. These refugees have been trapped in limbo due to Kashmir's special autonomy status and laws that deny citizenship to those not born in the undivided kingdom of Kashmir. This has created generational poverty, as refugees' children cannot attend state-run colleges or work in state government positions.\n\nThe passage notes that successive governments have avoided granting rights to these predominantly Hindu refugees to avoid disturbing the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. However, recent political developments have brought hope, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party (BJP) has won a share of power in Kashmir and is expected to champion the refugees' cause. Activist Labha Ram Gandhi expresses cautious optimism but warns they are prepared to take action if their rights aren't finally recognized.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest-think", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers compared data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and discovered that by age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with higher rates among those who received antibiotics as infants.\n\nThe effect was particularly pronounced in boys and increased with repeated antibiotic prescriptions before age two. Researchers theorize antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume food, making more calories available for absorption or potentially increasing appetite.\n\nDr. Antti Saari, the lead author, warns this effect could contribute to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and emphasizes the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy. The study adds to growing concerns about antibiotic over-prescription, which has already been linked to increased risk of eczema and digestive problems in children, as well as the development of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest-think", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Investing Solutions has received significant housing benefit payments by placing single homeless men (referred to by the charity) in private accommodations. Their business model involves claiming housing benefit for each tenant while paying less to property landlords, generating substantial profits. For example, in one property, they claimed £2,114 monthly while paying the landlord £1,150, creating an annual profit of £11,568.\n\nThe company targets homeless men over 35 because housing benefit legislation allows this demographic to be housed in private accommodations at higher rates (up to £260 weekly). A former tenant reported substandard living conditions including lack of heating, rats, and damp. Wandsworth Council has paid Investing Solutions over £2.1 million in two years. While neither organization operates illegally, Crisis charity described the arrangement as \"a new low.\" Patel maintains that Fresh Start is independent with its own trustees and that \"the bulk of rents\" go to private landlords.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest-think", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Post-Brexit, the UK should retain some elements of the Common Fisheries Policy, including science-based quotas, while managing new international obligations.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives remain optimistic, with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation seeing Brexit as an opportunity for \"full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone\" and fairer fishing rights.

Brown, who was previously knocked out during England's Six Nations match against Italy in February, pulled out of Harlequins' clash with Saracens due to ongoing headaches. He emphasizes the importance of careful recovery to avoid extended absences like those experienced by Johnny Sexton and George North, the latter having suffered four quick-fire concussions and being advised not to play again this season.\n\nBrown credits increased awareness of concussion symptoms, partly through World Rugby's online educational modules, for helping him make responsible decisions about his health. He advocates strongly for player safety, stating that if he could withdraw from a crucial England-Ireland Six Nations match, other players should likewise prioritize their health over competition, concluding \"it's just not worth pushing through.\"", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest-think", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

According to Professor David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University, heterosexual couples now have sex approximately three times monthly, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990.\n\nThe declining frequency may be attributed to smartphone use and increased connectivity, which have blurred boundaries between public and private life. People constantly checking emails and handling work matters in the evening leaves less dedicated time for intimate relationships.\n\nAs Catherine Mercer, a British National Survey researcher, notes, sex is becoming lower priority due to competing demands on people's time, with late-night digital connectivity making it difficult for couples to focus exclusively on their partners.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest-think", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once commanding prices up to £1.2 million as status symbols, these large dogs (weighing up to 80kg) are now being sent to slaughterhouses for meat and leather.\n\nThe decline is attributed to several factors:\n- China's anti-corruption campaign preventing their use as gifts to officials\n- City bans on dogs over 50kg\n- Poor breeding practices diminishing their quality\n- Urbanization making people realize they're unsuitable for city living\n\nAnimal welfare workers recently rescued 20 mastiffs in cramped cages heading to a slaughterhouse, with many dead or injured. Across China, these once-prized dogs are being stolen from streets or sold by breeders who can't sell their stock.
