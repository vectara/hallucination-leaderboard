Apple has introduced a two-step verification system to enhance security, which requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted device when logging in from a new device. This measure prevents unauthorized access to iCloud accounts and backups. While the feature is currently opt-in, security experts like Prof Alan Woodward suggest it should be the default setting. \n\nThe system works by:\n- Sending a four-digit code to a trusted mobile number or via Find My iPhone app\n- Blocking access without the code\n- Providing a 14-character recovery key for account recovery\n\nVladimir Katalov, the creator of the software previously used in the hacks, acknowledges that Apple's new security measures effectively prevent unauthorized access.

These refugees, primarily Hindus who fled during the 1947 partition, have been denied basic citizenship rights in Kashmir for nearly 70 years. Approximately 100,000 WPRs live in the Jammu region, unable to own property, vote in state elections, or access state government jobs.\n\nThe refugees' status stems from pre-independence laws and fears of disrupting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. Despite living in India and never visiting Pakistan, they remain in poverty, with families often intermarrying due to their low economic status.\n\nHowever, there is new hope with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gaining a share of power in Kashmir. The party has pledged to normalize the WPRs' status, which could potentially grant them state-subject rights. Activist Labha Ram Gandhi warns that if their hopes are again disappointed, the community is prepared to fight for their rights.\n\nThe passage highlights the ongoing struggle of these refugees to be recognized as full citizens, with their children facing significant limitations in education and employment opportunities.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-haiku", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He stated that people are born with a sexual preference and that he would attend a same-sex wedding of a family member or staffer, even if he disagrees with it. Rubio believes marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman, and that states should regulate marriage through legislative debate. He does not consider same-sex marriage a constitutional right and argues that courts should not make this decision. Rubio emphasized respecting loved ones' choices, drawing a parallel to his Catholic belief about divorce.

The study reveals that:\n\n1. Couples are now having sex approximately three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990.\n\n2. The decline may be attributed to increased technological connectivity, which has blurred boundaries between work, home, and personal life.\n\n3. People are constantly checking emails and feeling connected to work and other demands, which reduces intimate time with partners.\n\n4.

Abbott advocates for a \"stop the boats\" policy, which involves detaining migrants attempting to reach Australia by boat and processing them in offshore camps. The New York Times criticized this approach as \"brutal\" and \"inhumane\". \n\nRegarding the Syrian refugee crisis, Abbott argued that stopping boats was necessary to prevent migrant deaths, referencing the tragic death of three-year-old Alan Kurdi. He claimed Australia had successfully stopped \"illegal boats\".\n\nAbbott also made controversial remarks comparing the Islamic State (IS) to Nazis, suggesting IS was worse because they \"boast about their evil\". This comment drew criticism from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, who argued that IS's crimes cannot be equated with the systematic genocide of the Holocaust.

Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, among the last journalists working there, reflect on its rich history. Fleet Street was historically the hub of national newspapers, with nearly every major publication having offices within a half-mile radius. At its peak, newspapers were the primary source of public information, with a vibrant culture of socializing in pubs and bars.\n\nThe street's journalistic prominence began to decline in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his newspapers to Wapping, following a bitter year-long dispute with unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had relocated, adopting computerized printing technology and leaving behind buildings that were repurposed for other uses.\n\nThe closure of the Sunday Post's London office symbolizes the end of an era, with the last journalists like Sherriff and Smith marking the conclusion of Fleet Street's storied journalistic legacy.

He is known for his pace, dribbling skills, and ability to play on the left wing. While still young, he has been compared to players like Arjen Robben and even suggested by some to be more talented than a young Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nDuring the 2014 World Cup, Depay scored goals against Australia and Chile, and was nominated for the tournament's 'best young player' award.
