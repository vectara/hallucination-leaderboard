These tests screen cancer cells and quickly assess the risk of disease recurrence. For some women, the tests can confirm a recurrence risk as low as 5%, which is comparable to or better than outcomes with chemotherapy.\n\nCurrently, most breast cancer patients routinely undergo chemotherapy after tumor removal despite its difficult side effects including hair loss, nausea, fatigue, and weight changes. The newest test, called EndoPredict, allows patients with low scores to opt out of chemotherapy.\n\nWhile these tests cost about £2,500 and are mostly available privately, medical professionals hope they will soon be offered through the NHS, arguing the cost would be offset by savings from reduced chemotherapy treatments.

This map is the first in a series that will eventually create a 3D view of dark matter across one-eighth of the night sky.\n\nThe map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel device mounted on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile as part of the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES). Since dark matter cannot be directly observed, scientists studied its gravitational effects on galaxies through a technique called gravitational lensing.\n\nThe map reveals large filaments of dark matter where galaxies and galaxy clusters tend to form, supporting current cosmological theories that galaxies form in areas with higher concentrations of dark matter. The research team analyzed 130 million separate telescope images using supercomputers to measure galaxy shapes with extreme precision.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the DES is to map 12.5 percent of the entire sky by 2018, creating a comprehensive 3D map of both dark matter and dark energy. This will help scientists better understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to be causing the universe's expansion to accelerate.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The author counters this argument by noting that historically, male hormones have impaired leadership decisions, and studies show women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks.\n\nThe article points out that despite women outnumbering men in education and the workforce, gender bias remains a significant barrier. It cites evidence of this bias, such as the disproportionate number of men named John, Robert, William, or James on corporate boards compared to all women combined. The author argues that equality benefits everyone - improving business outcomes, family dynamics, and marriages.\n\nThe passage concludes by noting that Rios's threat to move to Canada if Clinton is elected demonstrates her ignorance, as Canada had already had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite living in India for nearly 70 years, these Hindu refugees are denied full citizenship rights in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. They cannot own property, vote in state elections, attend state-run colleges, or work for the state government.\n\nApproximately 100,000 WPRs, mostly living in the Jammu region, have been trapped in poverty for three generations due to a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to those born in the undivided kingdom of Kashmir. The reluctance to grant them full rights stems from concerns about altering the demographic balance in the Muslim-majority state.\n\nHowever, there is new hope following the recent election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a coalition government in Kashmir. The BJP is expected to champion the refugees' cause, though activist Labha Ram Gandhi warns that if their hopes are dashed again, the community may take more drastic action.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This map is the first in a series that will eventually create a 3D view of dark matter across one-eighth of the night sky.\n\nThe map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel device mounted on the Victor M.

Since dark matter cannot be directly observed, scientists studied its gravitational effects on galaxies through a technique called gravitational lensing.\n\nThe map reveals large filaments of dark matter where galaxies and galaxy clusters tend to form, supporting current cosmological theories that galaxies form in areas with higher concentrations of dark matter. The research team analyzed 130 million separate telescope images using supercomputers to measure galaxy shapes with extreme precision.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the DES is to map 12.5 percent of the entire sky by 2018, creating a comprehensive 3D map of both dark matter and dark energy.

Spiegelhalter suggests smartphone use and constant connectivity may be responsible for this decline, as people are continuously checking emails and the boundaries between work and personal life have eroded.
