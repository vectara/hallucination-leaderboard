Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of killing his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012. Costa allegedly stomped on Freebody's head, cut his throat and stabbed him multiple times. Costa made triple 0 calls during the attack, suggesting his confused mental state. Costa's state of mind is critical to the case, as the jury must determine whether his unstable mindset at the time of the attack can be proven.", "company": "apple", "model_name": "OpenELM-3B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The untried Barkley took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it.

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-iPad classes.

Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who do n't (stock image above). Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users.

Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, firechat creates localised networks in which each phone becomes a node, and data is passed between nodes.
