The untried Barkley took the 10th minute kick â awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon â rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it.

Sakho slotted in his first goal since November from Sam Byram's pass, before Ayew tucked into the same bottom corner moments later.

James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton. The best moment for Cheltenham, who were unchanged from Saturday's 3-0 league defeat by Carlisle, came with Pell's low volley across goal, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post.

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-iPad classes.

Apple added multipeer connectivity framework ( mcf ) to iOS 7, creating wireless mesh networks that connect phones to each other. Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, firechat creates localised networks in which each phone becomes a node, and data is passed between nodes. Apple uses the framework for its airdrop feature, for example, which makes it easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way â around 200ft (61 metres) â and greenstone has been designed to overcome these. When a user opens the firechat app, they pick a screen name to start sending messages.
