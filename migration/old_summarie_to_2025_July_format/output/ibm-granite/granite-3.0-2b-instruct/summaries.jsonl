The industry has been marginalized in wider Brexit negotiations due to its low GDP contribution and employment figures. However, many in the industry argue that Brexit offers the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. The UK's fishing industry is heavily reliant on EU member states for market access, and Brexit may involve trade-offs, such as EU member states demanding more access to UK waters in return for continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs. The report suggests that many elements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) should be retained post-Brexit, and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas continue to be based on scientific advice. The report also highlights the potential for four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if Britain leaves the EU. Despite concerns, many in the industry believe that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats,", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.0-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The industry has been marginalized in wider Brexit negotiations due to its low GDP contribution and employment figures. However, many in the industry argue that Brexit offers the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. The UK's fishing industry is heavily reliant on EU member states for market access, and Brexit may involve trade-offs, such as EU member states demanding more access to UK waters in return for continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs. The report suggests that many elements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) should be retained post-Brexit, and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas continue to be based on scientific advice. The report also highlights the potential for four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if Britain leaves the EU. Despite concerns, many in the industry believe that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats,", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.0-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
