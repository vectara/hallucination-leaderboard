NHS Improvement, the regulator, aims to decrease this by Â£1bn by the end of the current financial year. A cap on agency staff costs was introduced in October, saving Â£600m so far. The cap limits hospitals, mental health trusts, and ambulance services to paying no more than 55% above normal shift rates for agency staff, excluding senior managers. The goal is to lower the overall cost of agency staff and reduce hospitals' reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive due to additional fees and employer costs. While progress is promising, the NHS is still short of its target, with trusts 10% below their desired agency spending. The agency bill is decreasing, but it's unclear if spending on other pay elements has increased.

The study also found that despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level.

Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities have impacted the breed's popularity. The dogs are now being used for their meat in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare workers have rescued a group of dogs from a slaughterhouse, but it is feared that many more are meeting a similar fate.
