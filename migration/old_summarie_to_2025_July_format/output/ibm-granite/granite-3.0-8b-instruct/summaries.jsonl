NHS Improvement, the regulator, aims to decrease this by £1bn by the end of the current financial year. A cap on agency staff costs was introduced in October, saving £600m so far. The cap limits hospitals, mental health trusts, and ambulance services to paying no more than 55% above normal shift rates for agency staff, excluding senior managers. The goal is to lower the overall cost of agency staff and reduce hospitals' reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive due to additional fees and employer costs. While progress is promising, the NHS is still short of its target, with trusts 10% below their desired agency spending. The agency bill is decreasing, but it's unclear if spending on other pay elements has increased. NHS Improvement will publish league tables of trusts' agency spending and collect data on the highest-earning agency staff per trust.

Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month. The study found that women's drinking habits have been changing, with binge drinking rates among women rising more than seven times the rate among men in some areas. The study also found that despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level. The increase in binge drinking does not surprise clinical director Terri Fukagawa, who has seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years.

Apple has now implemented a two-step verification process to prevent unauthorized access. This process requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to their trusted mobile phone or Apple's Find My iPhone app, in addition to their username and password. If users do not enter the code, they are blocked from making purchases or accessing their account. Apple previously offered two-step verification, but it was not activated for iCloud backups. This allowed hackers to use Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker to download complete backups of users' data. Elcomsoft's owner confirmed that his software was used in the recent hacks, but Apple's new changes prevent this technique.
