The research, conducted by Finnish scientists, analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, comparing their weight and height with their antibiotic prescription records. The findings indicate that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Notably, children who were prescribed antibiotics during their early infancy, especially if the treatment was repeated, showed a higher likelihood of being overweight. Boys appeared to be more susceptible to weight gain post-antibiotic treatment, and they also tended to be slightly taller.\n\nWhile the study did not definitively prove that antibiotics cause weight gain, it suggests a potential mechanism: antibiotics might eliminate beneficial gut bacteria that normally aid in digestion, leaving more food available for the body and potentially increasing appetite. This could contribute to the obesity epidemic, which is already concerning, with one in five boys and one in ten girls in England being overweight or obese by age 10-11.\n\nDr. Antti Saari, the lead author, emphasized the need for cautious antibiotic use in infancy, warning that excessive exposure could exacerbate the global childhood obesity issue. He also highlighted the broader concern about antibiotics losing their effectiveness due to overuse, which could lead to more severe infections. The study underscores the importance of balancing the benefits of antibiotics with the potential risks, particularly in early childhood.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This proposal, outlined in the \"Ending Expensive Social Tenancies\" report, aims to stimulate the largest social house building program since the 1970s. Neil O'Brien, Policy Exchange's director, asserts that this strategy would reduce the number of people waiting for social housing by approximately 500,000. \n\nHowever, Labour opposes this plan, arguing that it would exacerbate the housing crisis by driving low-income families out of desirable neighborhoods. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey contends that the government should instead use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and employ unemployed builders to boost the construction industry.\n\nPolicy Exchange identifies expensive social housing (worth more than the average property in each region) as 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, totaling 816,000 properties. Selling these could potentially raise up to £159bn. London alone holds over £70bn of such properties. The think tank suggests that about 3.5% of social housing becomes vacant annually, enabling the sale of 28,500 properties yearly, generating £5.5bn. After debt repayment, this would reduce to £4.5bn.\n\nCritics, including the National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck, warn that this could lead to a \"dramatic erosion\" of mixed communities, pushing lower-income families into new ghettos.

Notable figures like Robin Esser, a former Sunday Express editor, highlight its importance, especially during the early days of television and before the advent of social media, when 85% of public information came through newspapers.\n\nGavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, both veteran journalists from the Dundee-based Sunday Post, worked in Fleet Street for 32 and 25 years respectively. They describe the street as a vibrant hub filled with bars and pubs, where journalists and printers socialized and sought stories. The atmosphere was lively, with smoke-filled newsrooms and typewriters being the norm.\n\nHowever, the era of Fleet Street's dominance began to wane in the late 1980s when media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, sparking a dispute with unions. This led to most national newspapers relocating to other parts of London, adopting computerized printing technology. Consequently, the iconic Fleet Street buildings transformed into various commercial uses.\n\nSmith, now a freelance journalist, and Sherriff, taking time to write his memoirs, reflect on their experiences. Despite the closure of their London office, they express a sense of pride and nostalgia for being part of this historic journalistic landscape. Their departure marks the end of an era, with the buildings now housing supermarkets, restaurants, and other businesses, yet the legacy of Fleet Street remains a significant part of British media history.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This study, which has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, also highlights that poverty significantly heightens the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. Poorer youth are approximately five times more likely to be under statutory supervision than their better-off peers, even when other risk factors are considered.\n\nThe research underscores that household poverty acts as an amplifier for offending behavior, with individuals in extreme poverty being more prone to both victimization and perpetration of crimes. Gender plays a significant role too, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds twice as likely to be involved in violent crime, even after accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and inadequate parental supervision.\n\nThe study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government, was published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal. Professor Lesley McAra, the report's author, emphasized that the interaction between poverty and the juvenile justice system inadvertently perpetuates conditions conducive to violence.\n\nDespite a recent decline in overall crime rates in Scotland, the study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh's Law School indicates that the most crime-ridden communities remain disproportionately poor, with high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment. This suggests that crime remains concentrated amongst the poorest and most vulnerable, a trend that persists even as overall crime rates decrease.\n\nThe Scottish government, acknowledging the 41-year low in recorded crime, homicide rates at their lowest in 39 years, and increased police presence, maintains that it is actively addressing poverty and inequalities through initiatives like a £296 million investment to mitigate the impacts of UK welfare cuts.

This study debunks the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggests women avoid asking for pay rises due to fear of upsetting their bosses or adhering to stereotypes. The research found no evidence supporting this notion. Instead, it revealed that men are 25% more likely to receive a pay rise when they ask for one, compared to women. When comparing full-time male and female workers, and part-time male and female workers, the study controlled for factors like employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications. The findings suggest that women and men under 40 ask for and receive pay rises equally, indicating a potential shift in negotiating behavior among younger women. Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick, a co-author, noted that the results imply a degree of discrimination against women in the workplace, possibly due to men's reluctance to publicly share unsuccessful pay rise requests.

Two recent polls indicated the Leave camp was gaining, with the implied probability of a Remain vote dropping to 68.5% from 80% a week prior. Analysts predict that upcoming polls will further impact the pound, potentially causing more volatility as the referendum approaches. Hedge funds have been short-selling sterling, expecting its value to fall further.\n\nThe FTSE 100, London's main index, initially dipped 0.3% but ended the day down 1.1% at 6,044.9 points, with Lloyds Banking Group being the largest loser, down 4.2%. Asian stock markets also reacted negatively, with Japan's Nikkei index down 3.5% and Hong Kong's main index falling 2.5%.\n\nDespite these economic concerns, the UK's trade deficit narrowed in April due to increased exports, as highlighted by official figures.

This contrasts with the party's previous stance against such policies. The country's tourism sector, particularly Athens airport, is experiencing a significant surge with 25 million expected arrivals this year, up from 21 million, indicating a growing interest in Greece as a holiday destination.\n\nThe reasons behind this apparent acceptance of austerity measures are multifaceted. One theory suggests that Greeks might be anticipating the potential euro break-up, hoping to witness history. Another possibility is that Greece's appeal as a safer holiday destination compared to areas under Islamic State control is a major draw.\n\nThe lack of public resistance could be attributed to the impending revelation of the extent of concessions made by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to secure an additional €86 billion in credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF. This third bailout aims to stabilize Greece's economy, which has been crippled by debt.\n\nTsipras' decision to agree to these terms, despite his party's election campaign against them, is often attributed to Greece's near-bankruptcy in July, which transformed Syriza into advocates of the \"there is no alternative\" (TINA) approach. Despite this, Tsipras remains popular, possibly due to the economic uncertainty and the need for stability.\n\nHowever, Greece is grappling with a severe economic squeeze, exacerbated by the continued partial bank closure, which limits lending capacity. This situation poses a significant risk to businesses, with many unable to secure foreign credit for investments, potentially leading to a cancelled Christmas season.\n\nThe success of this new bailout hinges on Tsipras' ability to instill hope for future prosperity.

By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to around 275 sq km, indicating a significant retreat. This study, presented at the AGU Fall Meeting, is based on research conducted by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie and her team. They analyzed roughly 600 glaciers across major French Alps massifs like Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc. Their inventory, the first in four decades, utilized map archives, past satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual inspections to validate satellite data, addressing issues like debris cover and shadows affecting glacier detection.\n\nThe initial French Alps glacier inventory, published in the 1980s, noted an overall area of about 375 sq km, which had decreased to nearly 340 sq km by 1985-86. The new survey reveals an average annual loss of approximately 26% over the past 40 years, with the retreat accelerating since the late 1980s. The southern sectors of the French Alps have experienced the most substantial glacial retreat, with the Belledonne Massif seeing almost complete glacier disappearance and the Ecrins Massif showing retreat more than three times faster than the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nThe northern Alps, with their higher mountain elevations and different climatic conditions, have seen less dramatic glacier retreat. The largest French glacier, La Mer de Glace, which descends Mont Blanc, has reduced to about 30 sq km, slightly less than its 1960s/1970s size of 31.5 sq km. This study underscores ongoing efforts to monitor and assess glacier health across the Alpine region, with similar findings reported by Swiss researchers about glacier mass loss in their part of the European Alps.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, initiated a competitive race to map the human genome, which led to both acclaim and criticism from the scientific community. Despite his assertive nature, his contributions significantly expedited the human genome project. Post-human genome publication, Venter focused on creating synthetic life forms, culminating in the creation of Synthia, a synthetic organism, published in Science in 2010.\n\nBorn in 1946, Venter's life took a dramatic turn during his service in Vietnam, where he worked as a naval hospital orderly, witnessing the high cost of life. This experience instilled in him a strong sense of urgency and a commitment to efficiency. He pursued medical training, excelling in research rather than practice.\n\nIn the 1980s, Venter was instrumental in the early molecular biology revolution, recognizing the importance of gene decoding. He introduced automated decoding machines to his lab, speeding up the process. His breakthrough came when he shifted focus from the DNA blueprint to RNA, the messenger molecules cells use naturally, enabling rapid generation of gene sequences.\n\nVenter's work, though initially met with skepticism from notable scientists like James Watson, led to his departure from the National Institutes of Health in 1992. He founded The Institute for Genomic Research and, in 1995, became the first to sequence the genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics, aiming to decode the human genome in three years, challenging the public project's 10-year timeline. Both efforts published their results in 2001. Venter's approach, which prioritized commercialization and speed over open data access, was met with controversy and criticism.\n\nDespite this, Venter's financial success from Celera Genomics provided him with substantial resources to establish the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006. This institute led the creation of the world's first synthetic life form, Synthia, through an extensive genetic exploration of marine microbes.\n\nVenter's synthetic life project, while controversial, holds potential for environmental benefits, such as aiding in carbon capture and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The report also reveals that only 61,000 new apprenticeships in England are for young people, contrasting with Germany's 570,000, 90% of which are at A-level equivalence.\n\nThe Sutton Trust calls for a substantial expansion of apprenticeships, proposing up to 300,000 new starts annually, with a focus on level three apprenticeships lasting at least three years and some four-year level four courses. It suggests limiting two-year level two courses to no more than 10% of apprenticeships. The report emphasizes the need for a clear, respected vocational route, contrasting England's current patchwork system with Germany's, where 11 young people compete for each apprenticeship.\n\nHowever, the Association of Colleges warns that creating 300,000 new apprenticeships could be challenging, especially given the existing shortage of places for 16-year-olds. They also advocate for preserving some level two apprenticeships, like those in construction, which are valued by industry.

For BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years of diagnosis, the reduction in death was 73%. The 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4%.\n\nDr. Steven Narod from the Women's College Research Institute in Toronto advocated for further follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment, especially those who had the surgery within a year of breast cancer diagnosis. Journal editor Dr. Mary Disis emphasized the compelling results, suggesting that oophorectomy should be considered as part of treatment discussions for early-stage BRC1 mutation carriers with breast cancer.\n\nWomen with a significant family history of breast cancer, particularly those with a 50-80% lifetime risk due to BRC1 or BRC2 gene mutations, may benefit from genetic testing. The BRC1 mutation is more prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, affecting about 2.3% of these women. The study also highlighted that oophorectomy provides survival benefits, especially for those with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer, an aggressive form often resistant to drug treatment.\n\nAngelina Jolie, who has six children, stated that having her ovaries removed did not diminish her sense of femininity, emphasizing her personal choice and grounding in her family's well-being.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% engaged in binge drinking. The county with the lowest binge drinking rate was Madison County, Idaho (6%), while Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest (36%).\n\nExperts attribute this surge to several factors: changing social norms making women's drinking more similar to men's, increased binge drinking among young people, and affluent individuals' ability to afford more alcohol due to economic prosperity. The influx of wealthy tech professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, with their hard-partying lifestyles, is also cited as a contributing factor.\n\nAdditionally, factors like cheaper alcohol due to stagnant taxes, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies, such as looser sales restrictions and longer bar hours, are seen as contributing to the rise in excessive drinking.

As of now, there are 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases linked to this outbreak, an increase from 106 cases last week. This surge is primarily due to intravenous drug users, with a significant involvement of the high-powered painkiller Opana. Typically, Scott County sees around five HIV cases annually.\n\nThe program, which has provided 5,322 clean syringes to 86 participants and collected 1,400 used syringes, has gained traction, especially with a mobile unit visiting neighborhoods to enroll more intravenous drug users. However, the future of this program and potential state-wide needle exchange legislation remain uncertain. Governor Pence, who opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing the situation and is expected to decide on extending the program beyond April 25.\n\nThe CDC reports that 50% to 90% of people with hepatitis C are also HIV-positive, making high hepatitis C rates a strong indicator of needle-sharing and potential HIV outbreaks. Despite the House's approval of a bill (sponsored by Chairman Ed Clere) to allow 23 counties with high hepatitis C rates to establish their own needle-exchange programs, the Senate's stance is unclear. Senate President Pro Tem David Long acknowledges concerns about needle exchanges potentially promoting drug use but suggests a need to adapt to current realities.\n\nThe sustainability of such programs is questioned due to federal funding restrictions, which have barred public funding for needle exchange since 1989.

The assault, dubbed by Philadelphia authorities as the 'Tattoo Terrorists' operation, took place in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, northeast Philadelphia, from late March to early April 2014.\n\nCampbell, believing Vallecce had harmed his cat and stolen money and marijuana, orchestrated the attack along with Ng and Halin. They brutally beat, spat on, and tattooed Vallecce, who was tied to a chair for three days. The tattoos included 'Rip Pebbles', a smiley face with breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose, and offensive phrases like 'gay pride' and swastikas. Vallecce sustained severe injuries, including three broken ribs, two broken wrists, and facial fractures.\n\nThe trio filmed the abuse, with the video played in court. Vallecce managed to escape after 42 hours, contacting police. During a search of the house, authorities found a tattoo gun, needles, ink, and related paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana and prescription drugs. Vallecce has since had the tattoos removed at no cost, but the trauma has left him with lasting psychological distress.\n\nCampbell was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, Ng to 23 months, and Halin the same term. Another defendant, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial. The group was charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy, and false imprisonment, all of which they pleaded guilty to.

Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of boundaries between public and private lives, with constant smartphone use and email checking eroding \"quiet empty time\" that was previously available for intimacy.

The research, conducted by Finnish scientists, analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, comparing their weight and height with their antibiotic prescription records. The findings indicate that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Notably, children who were prescribed antibiotics during their early infancy, especially if the treatment was repeated, showed a higher likelihood of being overweight. Boys appeared to be more susceptible to weight gain post-antibiotic treatment, and they also tended to be slightly taller.\n\nWhile the study did not definitively prove that antibiotics cause weight gain, it suggests a potential mechanism: antibiotics might eliminate beneficial gut bacteria that normally aid in digestion, leaving more food available for the body and potentially increasing appetite. This could contribute to the obesity epidemic, which is already concerning, with one in five boys and one in ten girls in England being overweight or obese by age 10-11.\n\nDr. Antti Saari, the lead author, emphasized the need for cautious antibiotic use in infancy, warning that excessive exposure could exacerbate the global childhood obesity issue. He also highlighted the broader concern about antibiotics losing their effectiveness due to overuse, which could lead to more severe infections. The study underscores the importance of balancing the benefits of antibiotics with the potential risks, particularly in early childhood.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Dragon, carrying over 4,300 pounds of supplies, including research equipment and an espresso maker named ISSpresso, will dock with the ISS approximately two days post-launch.\n\nOnce docked, the space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They will then load it with approximately 3,000 pounds of additional supplies, experiments, and trash before guiding it back to Earth for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California.\n\nThis mission marks the sixth SpaceX delivery to the ISS, with SpaceX being the first private company to dock with the station.

To avoid paying, Phillips ran from the taxi, which pursued him in the dark. The driver, Dave Sidaway, testified that he couldn't see where he was going and wasn't aware of the danger. Phillips, disoriented, leapt over a fence and plunged down a cliff at the end of a disused promenade, the Northern Promenade or The Dardanelles. His body was discovered the next day by a dog walker. The coroner, Andrew Barkley, recorded an accidental death verdict, noting that Phillips likely became disoriented and was unaware of the cliff's hazardous drop-off.

This proposal, outlined in the \"Ending Expensive Social Tenancies\" report, aims to stimulate the largest social house building program since the 1970s. Neil O'Brien, Policy Exchange's director, asserts that this strategy would reduce the number of people waiting for social housing by approximately 500,000. \n\nHowever, Labour opposes this plan, arguing that it would exacerbate the housing crisis by driving low-income families out of desirable neighborhoods. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey contends that the government should instead use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and employ unemployed builders to boost the construction industry.\n\nPolicy Exchange identifies expensive social housing (worth more than the average property in each region) as 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, totaling 816,000 properties. Selling these could potentially raise up to £159bn. London alone holds over £70bn of such properties. The think tank suggests that about 3.5% of social housing becomes vacant annually, enabling the sale of 28,500 properties yearly, generating £5.5bn. After debt repayment, this would reduce to £4.5bn.\n\nCritics, including the National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck, warn that this could lead to a \"dramatic erosion\" of mixed communities, pushing lower-income families into new ghettos. They also highlight that the Labour government's social and affordable housing building program, cut by 60% under the coalition, has left many towns with fewer affordable options.\n\nIn response, Housing Minister Grant Shapps defends the government's reforms, including a £19.5bn investment in an affordable housing program, aiming to deliver up to 170,000 homes.

Poorer youth are approximately five times more likely to be under statutory supervision than their better-off peers, even when other risk factors are considered.\n\nThe research underscores that household poverty acts as an amplifier for offending behavior, with individuals in extreme poverty being more prone to both victimization and perpetration of crimes. Gender plays a significant role too, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds twice as likely to be involved in violent crime, even after accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and inadequate parental supervision.\n\nThe study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government, was published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal. Professor Lesley McAra, the report's author, emphasized that the interaction between poverty and the juvenile justice system inadvertently perpetuates conditions conducive to violence.\n\nDespite a recent decline in overall crime rates in Scotland, the study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh's Law School indicates that the most crime-ridden communities remain disproportionately poor, with high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment. This suggests that crime remains concentrated amongst the poorest and most vulnerable, a trend that persists even as overall crime rates decrease.\n\nThe Scottish government, acknowledging the 41-year low in recorded crime, homicide rates at their lowest in 39 years, and increased police presence, maintains that it is actively addressing poverty and inequalities through initiatives like a £296 million investment to mitigate the impacts of UK welfare cuts.

She explained that one client, an older gentleman, requested a \"Jackie O\" look and a smaller cup size to fit his specific outfit. Another advert sought a \"sexy female driver\" for a Porsche Cayenne, with a salary range of £40,000-£50,000 annually for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner.\n\nEmployment lawyer James Lynas asserted that these advertisements are \"clearly unlawful,\" citing the 2010 Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, race, or religion.

The findings suggest that women and men under 40 ask for and receive pay rises equally, indicating a potential shift in negotiating behavior among younger women.

Regular tests, including joint manipulations, X-rays, and fMRI scans, are performed to assess the sheep's health. The aim is to determine if cloned animals exhibit these conditions at a younger age than expected, as Dolly, the original clone, died at six-and-a-half years due to a lung virus and osteoarthritis.\n\nThe results of this extensive research, scheduled for publication, could significantly impact the future of cloning, addressing fundamental questions about the aging process in cloned animals.

This new security feature, known as two-step verification, introduces an additional authentication step after entering the username and password on a new device. This involves receiving a four-digit code via text or Apple's Find My iPhone app, which must be entered alongside the password. If the code is not provided, access to iCloud and associated services like iTunes, iBooks, or App Store is denied. Users can regain access using a 14-character recovery key, which should be kept secure.\n\nPreviously, this security measure was optional, but now it applies to iCloud usage, making it harder for attackers to download complete data backups even if they have a stolen or guessed password. Elcomsoft's software, marketed for law enforcement, was identified as potentially used in the recent hacks, but Apple's updated system now renders it ineffective.\n\nWhile Apple has long offered two-step verification, it wasn't previously enforced for iCloud access. The new system also notifies users via email when a backup starts, regardless of two-factor authentication status. However, security experts have mixed opinions. Some, like Vladimir Katalov from Elcomsoft, acknowledge the enhanced security but express concerns about the recovery key's vulnerability, suggesting it should be the default setting.

This contrasts with the party's previous stance against such policies. The country's tourism sector, particularly Athens airport, is experiencing a significant surge with 25 million expected arrivals this year, up from 21 million, indicating a growing interest in Greece as a holiday destination.\n\nThe reasons behind this apparent acceptance of austerity measures are multifaceted. One theory suggests that Greeks might be anticipating the potential euro break-up, hoping to witness history. Another possibility is that Greece's appeal as a safer holiday destination compared to areas under Islamic State control is a major draw.\n\nThe lack of public resistance could be attributed to the impending revelation of the extent of concessions made by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to secure an additional €86 billion in credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF. This third bailout aims to stabilize Greece's economy, which has been crippled by debt.\n\nTsipras' decision to agree to these terms, despite his party's election campaign against them, is often attributed to Greece's near-bankruptcy in July, which transformed Syriza into advocates of the \"there is no alternative\" (TINA) approach. Despite this, Tsipras remains popular, possibly due to the economic uncertainty and the need for stability.\n\nHowever, Greece is grappling with a severe economic squeeze, exacerbated by the continued partial bank closure, which limits lending capacity. This situation poses a significant risk to businesses, with many unable to secure foreign credit for investments, potentially leading to a cancelled Christmas season.\n\nThe success of this new bailout hinges on Tsipras' ability to instill hope for future prosperity.

In 1995, he announced the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics, aiming to decode the entire human genetic code in three years, challenging the public project's 10-year timeline. Both efforts published their results in 2001. Venter's approach, which prioritized commercialization and speed over open data access, was met with controversy.\n\nIn 2006, Venter established the J Craig Venter Institute to lead the creation of the first synthetic life form. His projects, including oceanic genetic surveys aboard his yacht, Sorcerer II, aim to understand gene and protein functions better. The announcement of Synthia in 2010, though controversial, marked a significant step towards synthetic biology, potentially revolutionizing industries and environmental conservation by aiding in carbon capture and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to around 275 sq km, indicating a significant retreat. This study, presented at the AGU Fall Meeting, is based on research conducted by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie and her team. They analyzed roughly 600 glaciers across major French Alps massifs like Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc. Their inventory, the first in four decades, utilized map archives, past satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual inspections to validate satellite data, addressing issues like debris cover and shadows affecting glacier detection.\n\nThe initial French Alps glacier inventory, published in the 1980s, noted an overall area of about 375 sq km, which had decreased to nearly 340 sq km by 1985-86. The new survey reveals an average annual loss of approximately 26% over the past 40 years, with the retreat accelerating since the late 1980s. The southern sectors of the French Alps have experienced the most substantial glacial retreat, with the Belledonne Massif seeing almost complete glacier disappearance and the Ecrins Massif showing retreat more than three times faster than the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nThe northern Alps, with their higher mountain elevations and different climatic conditions, have seen less dramatic glacier retreat. The largest French glacier, La Mer de Glace, which descends Mont Blanc, has reduced to about 30 sq km, slightly less than its 1960s/1970s size of 31.5 sq km.

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, initiated a competitive race to map the human genome, which led to both acclaim and criticism from the scientific community. Despite his assertive nature, his contributions significantly expedited the human genome project. Post-human genome publication, Venter focused on creating synthetic life forms, culminating in the creation of Synthia, a synthetic organism, published in Science in 2010.\n\nBorn in 1946, Venter's life took a dramatic turn during his service in Vietnam, where he worked as a naval hospital orderly, witnessing the high cost of life. This experience instilled in him a strong sense of urgency and a commitment to efficiency. He pursued medical training, excelling in research rather than practice.\n\nIn the 1980s, Venter was instrumental in the early molecular biology revolution, recognizing the importance of gene decoding. He introduced automated decoding machines to his lab, speeding up the process. His breakthrough came when he shifted focus from the DNA blueprint to RNA, the messenger molecules cells use naturally, enabling rapid generation of gene sequences.\n\nVenter's work, though initially met with skepticism from notable scientists like James Watson, led to his departure from the National Institutes of Health in 1992. He founded The Institute for Genomic Research and, in 1995, became the first to sequence the genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics, aiming to decode the human genome in three years, challenging the public project's 10-year timeline. Both efforts published their results in 2001. Venter's approach, which prioritized commercialization and speed over open data access, was met with controversy and criticism.\n\nDespite this, Venter's financial success from Celera Genomics provided him with substantial resources to establish the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006. This institute led the creation of the world's first synthetic life form, Synthia, through an extensive genetic exploration of marine microbes.\n\nVenter's synthetic life project, while controversial, holds potential for environmental benefits, such as aiding in carbon capture and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Jolie, 39, had this procedure (known as an oophorectomy) in March, following a double mastectomy due to her BRCA1 gene mutation, which significantly increases the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nA Canadian study analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with mutated BRCA1 or BRC2 genes. The findings indicate that oophorectomy, performed an average of six years post-diagnosis, reduced breast cancer deaths by 62% in BRCA1 mutation carriers. This protective effect was immediate and lasted for 15 years. However, it did not apply to BRC2 mutation carriers.\n\nThe study found a 65% reduction in all-cause deaths among oophorectomy recipients. For BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years of diagnosis, the reduction in death was 73%. The 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4%.\n\nDr. Steven Narod from the Women's College Research Institute in Toronto advocated for further follow-up studies on women who undergo oophorectomy as part of their initial treatment, especially those who had the surgery within a year of breast cancer diagnosis. Journal editor Dr. Mary Disis emphasized the compelling results, suggesting that oophorectomy should be considered as part of treatment discussions for early-stage BRC1 mutation carriers with breast cancer.\n\nWomen with a significant family history of breast cancer, particularly those with a 50-80% lifetime risk due to BRC1 or BRC2 gene mutations, may benefit from genetic testing. The BRC1 mutation is more prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, affecting about 2.3% of these women. The study also highlighted that oophorectomy provides survival benefits, especially for those with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer, an aggressive form often resistant to drug treatment.\n\nAngelina Jolie, who has six children, stated that having her ovaries removed did not diminish her sense of femininity, emphasizing her personal choice and grounding in her family's well-being.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Prime Minister David Cameron has personally intervened, urging FGW to reconsider fare increases on the London-Cotswolds route, which passes through his Witney constituency. The current off-peak return fare from Charlbury, near his home, is £33.30, but it will rise to £62.40 from May 17, an 87% increase. Cameron's constituents are outraged, prompting his intervention.\n\nTrain companies have three annual windows to adjust unregulated fares, which account for about half of their revenue, including off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets. FGW justifies the change by aligning the north Cotswolds route with other services, while offering a cheaper advanced single ticket option. Other significant hikes include:\n\n- Crewe to Northampton (London Midland) off-peak single from £30 to £37 (24.5% increase)\n- Stafford to Liverpool (Virgin) anytime return from £26.50 to £33 (24.5% increase)\n- Manchester to Stoke anytime first-class day return from £29 to £35.30 (22% increase)\n\nVirgin Rail defends these hikes, stating that the majority affect their own, cheaper 'Virgin trains-only fares' and that their overall fare increase this year on the West Coast is just 1.65%, below the industry average.

In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% engaged in binge drinking. The county with the lowest binge drinking rate was Madison County, Idaho (6%), while Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest (36%).\n\nExperts attribute this surge to several factors: changing social norms making women's drinking more similar to men's, increased binge drinking among young people, and affluent individuals' ability to afford more alcohol due to economic prosperity. The influx of wealthy tech professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, with their hard-partying lifestyles, is also cited as a contributing factor.\n\nAdditionally, factors like cheaper alcohol due to stagnant taxes, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies, such as looser sales restrictions and longer bar hours, are seen as contributing to the rise in excessive drinking.

However, the future of this program and potential state-wide needle exchange legislation remain uncertain. Governor Pence, who opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing the situation and is expected to decide on extending the program beyond April 25.\n\nThe CDC reports that 50% to 90% of people with hepatitis C are also HIV-positive, making high hepatitis C rates a strong indicator of needle-sharing and potential HIV outbreaks.

Senate President Pro Tem David Long acknowledges concerns about needle exchanges potentially promoting drug use but suggests a need to adapt to current realities.\n\nThe sustainability of such programs is questioned due to federal funding restrictions, which have barred public funding for needle exchange since 1989.
