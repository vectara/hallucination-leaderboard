The best moment for Cheltenham came with Harry Pell's volley, but onrushing substitute Dan Holman could not quite get the required touch as he slid in at the far post. The two sides' only previous meeting came at the same stage of this competition four years ago, resulting in a narrow 2-1 win for Hammers at their old home Upton Park. Slaven Bilic's side could have won by a greater margin, but Robins captain Kyle Storer cleared Angelo Ogbonna's fierce header off the line in the first half and, moments later, keeper Jonathan Flatt did well to stop Sakho turning in Ayew's low cross.

It highlights that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live, but the study found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, even after taking into account other factors such as truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, have been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.

It is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky. The map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe. University of Manchester researchers have revealed an HD dark matter map. It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4% of the sky. The goal is to eventually map 12.5% over five years. Red here shows more dark matter, and blue shows less. The moon is shown top left for scale. A team from the University of Manchester, led by Dr Sarah Bridle, has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map. The map was released today at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland. It was created using data captured by the dark energy camera, a 570 megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the dark energy survey (DES) led by Fermilab in the US. The survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M.
