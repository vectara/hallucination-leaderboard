FireChat, which launched last year and has been downloaded over five million times, utilizes Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) to create a local network in which each phone becomes a node and data is passed between nodes. This allows users to send messages and photos even when there is no mobile or data signal. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way, at around 200 feet (61 meters). Greenstone has been designed to solve this issue by acting as a booster to help messages move more easily within these networks. The device is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20 feet (6 meters). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life and can hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone, and the timeframe for this will depend on these", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday. NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Last week, Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: \"I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.\" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed. At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The team, which includes researchers from Exeter and Reading universities and Brazil's São Paulo and Belém universities, found more than 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation revealed them. The function of these mysterious sites is still little understood, but it is thought they were used sporadically as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America or Britain's Stonehenge. The team analyzed soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal quantities, and carbon stable isotopes to reconstruct ancient vegetation and assess the amount of ancient forest burning. The research suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, and raises questions about their purpose. The new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans. The team has likened it to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The PDP lost control of key northern states and three states affected by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies. The APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari. The elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money.

Poorer young people were also more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. Household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime.

The case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, and the family of Barry Pring believes he was killed in a staged hit and run accident. The inquest heard that Barry's wife, Ganna Ziuzina, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove and tried to claim his assets within days of his death. The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement. The inquest also heard that Ms Ziuzina sold Mr Pring's Range Rover, contents from his flat, and moved funds from his bank account. The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry.

This feature requires users to enter a four-digit code in addition to their username and password when accessing their iCloud account from a device they have not used before. The code is either sent to a trusted mobile phone number or via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the user does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making purchases on iTunes, iBooks, or the App Store. Users can also use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to their account in case their trusted device is lost or stolen. Apple had previously offered the two-step verification system, but it had not been activated when device owners used the firm's backup service.

The APC leader, Muhammadu Buhari, will be inaugurated on May 29th after defeating President Goodluck Jonathan in the presidential poll. The PDP lost control of key northern states and three states affected by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies. The APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari. The elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fueled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
