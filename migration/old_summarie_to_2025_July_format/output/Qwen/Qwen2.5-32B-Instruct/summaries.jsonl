Key points include:\n\n- Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action.\n- Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among youth.\n- A history of police involvement strongly predicts lack of education, employment, or training by age 18.\n- Poorer youth are five times more likely to be under statutory supervision.\n- Extreme poverty correlates with higher victimization and perpetration of crime.\n- Boys are three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls.\n- Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to those from affluent households.\n\nThe research highlights a cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, which in turn increases the risk of further poverty due to involvement with the juvenile justice system.
