The research suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by affecting the gut bacteria that normally help digest food, potentially leading to weight gain. The study, conducted by Finnish researchers, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-old children with records on antibiotic prescriptions. By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before the age of two increasing the odds of being overweight. The study did not prove causation but highlighted the potential role of antibiotics in childhood obesity. The lead author warned about the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy. The study also noted that the obesity epidemic is more pronounced in boys, and there is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The closure of the Sunday Post's London office symbolizes the end of an era, as the traditional print media industry declines. The passage also highlights the historical significance of Fleet Street, its role in the development of British journalism, and the transition to more modern forms of media. It mentions the decline of Fleet Street due to the move of major newspapers to other parts of London and the adoption of new technologies. The story concludes with a reflection on the legacy of Fleet Street and the ongoing impact of its history on the current media landscape.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It found that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action for the same crime as better-off children. Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls. Poorer young people are also five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The study highlights a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can exacerbate poverty. The findings were published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal, and the study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998. The Scottish government claims Scotland is becoming a safer place to live, with crime at a 41-year low, but the study also shows that crime remains concentrated in the most deprived areas, raising questions about addressing inequality.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These earthworks, concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest, were revealed due to modern deforestation and include over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs.\" The function of these sites is unclear, but they are unlikely to be villages or defensive structures, and may have been used as ritual gathering places. Dr. Loader analyzed soil samples and found that the geoglyphs were constructed among taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy. The research challenges the assumption that the Amazon was pristine before European contact, indicating that humans have been influencing the environment for thousands of years, possibly through agroforestry practices.

The UK government claims that Scottish ministers will have £390m more in spending available to them next year. However, the Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010, along with the recent spending review, mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11. Mr. Swinney emphasized that the UK government has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, with more than £1bn of those cuts still to come. He also stated that Scotland will defend and protect key priorities such as schools, hospitals, and the police service. The UK government's Scotland Office responded by stating that the Scottish government will have £390m more spending available next year, and that the block grant will be almost £30bn.

The Lords review warns that these communities could be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is seen as detrimental to the UK fishing industry, which helped drive the leave vote. However, Brexit could offer the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, similar to Norway. The House of Lords European Union Committee report notes that the fishing industry is a low priority for the government but must not be marginalized. The UK's fishing industry is complex due to shared fish stocks with EU coastal states and reliance on EU markets. The report suggests that the CFP should be retained post-Brexit, and the UK should continue to cooperate with neighboring states. There is a risk of four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if the CFP framework falls away.

It highlights that fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum. The Lords review warns that these communities may be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been viewed as detrimental to the UK fishing industry, but Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. The report notes that the UK fishing industry is a low priority for the government but must not be marginalized. The industry faces challenges due to shared fish stocks with EU coastal states and the need for continued market access. The report suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the CFP and continue to cooperate with neighboring states. There is concern about the potential for four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these challenges, the fishing industry remains optimistic about the future post-Brexit, with some analysts viewing the recent EU quota agreement as a positive sign. The UK government emphasizes the opportunity to review fisheries management for fair access to quotas, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Additionally, the increasing size of vehicles and a lack of interest from children in earning money by washing cars are also factors.

The allegations claim that Olam and Temasek are turning a blind eye to unsustainable palm oil trading practices, which may contribute to the annual haze in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. The haze is primarily caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Olam denies the allegations, stating it has a strict sourcing policy that prohibits burning, peat use, and deforestation. It also claims it buys 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers and is a relative newcomer to the industry. The report suggests that Olam's sourcing practices may be encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading, which could be linked to the haze. Temasek has also denied the allegations, stating it supports no-burn policies and does not direct the operations of its portfolio companies.

Heavy drinking is defined as more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men in a single occasion. The study also found that binge drinking rates among women increased more than seven times faster than among men. In Santa Clara County, women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, with 8% of Americans considered heavy drinkers and 18% binge drinkers in 2012. The increase in binge drinking is attributed to changing social norms, cultural factors, economic influences, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study also notes that about 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking is estimated at over $220 billion per year.", "company": "Qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that the frequency of sex for Britons has decreased since the internet's emergence, with a typical heterosexual couple now having sex three times a month, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Professor Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to increased technological connectivity, which has blurred the boundaries between work, home, and the outside world, leading to less time for intimacy. He also notes that the constant connectivity, such as checking emails, reduces the quiet time needed for sexual activity.

Additionally, recent city bans on owning dogs over 50 kg have impacted their popularity. The dogs, traditionally used in Tibet for herding, are now facing a cruel fate, with reports of them being crammed into cages and some already dead.
