Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain. This dislike helped mobilize many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June. Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry. Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it \"must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations\". The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states. One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain. This dislike helped mobilize many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June. Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry. Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it \"must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations\". The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states. One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Experts believe recurrence risk varies, and chemotherapy may not be necessary for some. The endopredict test, if it shows a low score, allows patients to opt out of chemotherapy.

Heavy drinking rose by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, mainly due to rising rates among women. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men. The study found that women's drinking habits are driving this trend, with women's binge drinking rates increasing more than seven times compared to men. The study tracks adult drinking patterns at the county level and highlights that the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged. In some areas, such as Santa Clara County, women's binge drinking rates increased by nearly 36%, while in others, like Idaho's Madison County, it was the lowest. The study also notes that the percentage of people who drink alcohol has remained stable, and the number of deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 was estimated at $220 billion.
