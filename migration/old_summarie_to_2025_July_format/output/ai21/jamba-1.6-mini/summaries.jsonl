The study, which involved more than 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, found that children who had been given antibiotics in the first six months of life were more likely to be overweight or obese by the age of two. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. The researchers suggested that antibiotics may be contributing to the obesity epidemic by killing off gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but the researchers warned that the extended use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Poverty increases the risk of violence among both boys and girls, and a history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of being not in education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their wealthier counterparts. Household poverty increases the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study also found that people in extreme poverty are more likely to be victims and perpetrators of crime, with boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violence. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime. The study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 and was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government. The recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefited areas with the most chronic crime rates, with victims of the most crime found in the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates are in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, and a third are in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. The Scottish government has a long-standing record of protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society and is tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through various initiatives, including a £296m investment to limit the damaging effects of UK government welfare cuts.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The function of these sites is still not fully understood, but they are thought to have been used sporadically for ritual gatherings, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America or Britain's Stonehenge. The researchers also found evidence of human influence on the Amazonian forests, with a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, suggesting that people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms.

Morocco, meanwhile, was only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation. Both countries are now preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco.\n\nMorocco was punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.\n\nThe host nation was also at the center of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. Tunisia was leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.\n\nTunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. \"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,\" said Snoussi. \"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.\" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia, and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya, and Sao Tome in Group F.

This was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990, according to research published in Professor Spiegelhalter's book, Sex by Numbers.\n\nProfessor Spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity, with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own. However, he added that a more realistic explanation is that, as people have become better connected technologically, their lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work, and the outside world. This has squeezed out the time they would have spent with their other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying, \"With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.\"", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The incident, which lasted about 42 hours, occurred in the basement of a rowhouse in Mayfair, North Philadelphia, where the victim was held captive and tortured. The ringleader, Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat and stolen money and drugs. Campbell, along with his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, took turns punching, slapping, and spitting on Valecce before tying him to a chair. Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' on Valecce's right arm, along with a smiley face with breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose. Halin then took over the tattoo gun, inking swastikas, stars of David, two variations of the n-word, and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'gay pride' beside it. Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists, and fractured bones in his face. He escaped on April 1 while the others slept and contacted police. The court heard that Campbell, Ng, and Halin were 'wannabe gangsters' who filmed the abuse. Campbell was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, Halin received the same sentence, and Ng was sentenced to 23 months in a state prison. Another man involved, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while another defendant, Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study, which involved more than 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, found that children who had been given antibiotics in the first six months of life were more likely to be overweight or obese by the age of two. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. The researchers suggested that antibiotics may be contributing to the obesity epidemic by killing off gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but the researchers warned that the extended use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The three-bedroom home also comes with all the original 1930s cupboards in the kitchen, a brick open-face fire, and a dated kitchen sink. While some features have been upgraded, such as double glazing, the cost of renovations may deter developers. The historic house will be auctioned on April 30 at the County Ground in Bristol.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A few days after he was discharged, he became unwell and developed a rash. Mrs. Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash \"from head to foot\" but not on his arms. The following morning, Mr. Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat. Public Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death. The family said they had no idea how Mr. Colfer-Williams got measles, as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Poverty increases the risk of violence among both boys and girls, and a history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of being not in education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their wealthier counterparts. Household poverty increases the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study also found that people in extreme poverty are more likely to be victims and perpetrators of crime, with boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violence. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime. The study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 and was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government. The recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefited areas with the most chronic crime rates, with victims of the most crime found in the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates are in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, and a third are in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.

Morocco, meanwhile, was only able to enter the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned a ban on its participation. Both countries are now preparing for a future full of good things for both Africa and Morocco.\n\nMorocco was punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began. The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead. Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (£675,000) to $50,000 (£34,000). Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.\n\nThe host nation was also at the center of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over. Tunisia was leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty. The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared. The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup. Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.\n\nTunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement. \"Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page,\" said Snoussi. \"We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.\" Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia, and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya, and Sao Tome in Group F.

The ringleader, Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat and stolen money and drugs. Campbell, along with his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, took turns punching, slapping, and spitting on Valecce before tying him to a chair. Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' on Valecce's right arm, along with a smiley face with breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose. Halin then took over the tattoo gun, inking swastikas, stars of David, two variations of the n-word, and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'gay pride' beside it. Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists, and fractured bones in his face. He escaped on April 1 while the others slept and contacted police. The court heard that Campbell, Ng, and Halin were 'wannabe gangsters' who filmed the abuse. Campbell was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, Halin received the same sentence, and Ng was sentenced to 23 months in a state prison. Another man involved, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while another defendant, Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet. It comes after Professor Spiegelhalter revealed in a new book how a typical heterosexual couple was now having sex three times a month. This was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990, according to research published in Professor Spiegelhalter's book, Sex by Numbers.\n\nProfessor Spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity, with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own. However, he added that a more realistic explanation is that, as people have become better connected technologically, their lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work, and the outside world. This has squeezed out the time they would have spent with their other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying, \"With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.\"", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The breed's fall from grace is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has made it less acceptable to give such dogs as gifts. Additionally, recent bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several Chinese cities have further impacted their popularity. The breed, traditionally used for herding in Tibet, can weigh up to 80 kg. The dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skin used for leather belts. Some are also stolen and sold to slaughterhouses. Unscrupulous breeders have contributed to the problem by cross-breeding the dogs to make more money, resulting in a glut of poor-quality dogs that cannot be sold. The breed's boom began in 2005, with one puppy selling for £1.2 million just 13 months ago.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
