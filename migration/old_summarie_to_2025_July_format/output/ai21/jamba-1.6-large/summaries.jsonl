The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records of antibiotic prescriptions. They found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by the age of two, and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being overweight. Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics caused weight gain, but if they do, it may be because they kill off gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. The lead author warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy was associated with increased body mass in healthy children, and such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic. The study comes amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Guffick also altered some of the pupil's answers himself before the papers were sent off. The Department for Education annulled all SATs exam results for the school after an investigation by the local education authority found that some pupils had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. Guffick was forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. However, he insisted that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. The panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. The panel chair, Martin Pilkington, said that although Guffick's conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years.

Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts from Donald Sterling after Sterling's wife, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling, sued Stiviano. Shelly Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men and claimed that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover, and a $1.8 million duplex. Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of him. Shelly Sterling's lawyer called the court decision a victory for the Sterling family and said it sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of ill-begotten gifts. The gifts from Donald Sterling to Stiviano included a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender, and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of him arguing with Stiviano, in which he chastised her for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million, and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and led it for three decades across six continents. The AAM produced over 200 CDs, including the first complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. His 1980 recording of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson is considered one of the top 20 recordings of all time by BBC Music Magazine.\n\nHogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge and later with notable musicians like Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. He began his career as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He served as the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society, and held academic positions at Harvard, Cambridge, and Cornell.\n\nTributes from colleagues and friends highlight his significant contributions to music and his influence on many musicians. Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, praised his generosity and role as an ambassador for historically informed music. Richard Egarr, AAM's music director, acknowledged Hogwood's legacy. Dame Emma Kirkby and David Thomas from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance remembered him as a natural academic, a genial person, and a proponent of letting music speak for itself.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Living in poverty increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The study also found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment, or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. Household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. People who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims and perpetrators of crime. Gender was also identified as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behavior and lifestyles. The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government. The study's findings highlight a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risks of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. The study also found that the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. The findings suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighborhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. The Scottish government has a long-standing record of protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society and is tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives, including a £296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A pilot scheme in Cwm Cynon and Castell-nedd focuses on patients suspected of having cancer but showing no urgent signs or symptoms. This follows a visit by Welsh health officials to Denmark, where improved diagnostic systems have enhanced cancer survival rates. In Wales, there is concern that patients without clear symptoms may wait too long for a diagnosis, as they do not easily fit into a specific treatment pathway. This can result in multiple referrals and tests, taking several weeks. The fear is that many patients begin treatment only after their cancer has progressed.\n\nIn the pilot scheme, 40 doctors in Cwm Cynon can refer patients to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, within seven days. About six patients per week are expected to be seen and undergo various tests, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms in the Cwm Taf area receive a diagnosis. Doctors aim to diagnose a majority of patients with less obvious symptoms earlier. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board.\n\nThe trials, developed over the past 12 months following a visit by Welsh specialists to Aarhus, Denmark, aim to address concerns about Denmark's cancer survival rates. Dr. Gareth Davies, Associate Director of the Wales Cancer Network, believes the scheme will reassure patients and accelerate the diagnostic process. Dr. Gareth Jordan, a GP in Aberdâr, thinks the pilot could significantly impact patients' lives by enabling earlier diagnoses. If the Cwm Cynon pilot, which will last six months, is successful, the service will be extended to other health boards in the region.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Investors have been spooked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen, although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries. With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier. Hedge funds have been placing bets - short-selling - on expectations that the value of sterling will sink further. The bears are in town. Polls show it's now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity. Sterling has shed more than 2% in two sessions to retrace its April lows. Worries about the economic impact of leaving the EU were also blamed for a big fall in Asian stock markets. Japan's Nikkei index closed 3.5% down, while Hong Kong's main index slid 2.5%.

The study also reveals that three-quarters of women never wash their own car, with drivers more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt. The survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV found that 31% of men have never washed their own car, with only 12% of those that do saying they do it regularly. Meanwhile, only 5% of those surveyed said they had ever asked their children to wash the car as a way for them to earn extra pocket money.\n\nFactors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a Sunday and more live football on TV, meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend. The rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars. Other reasons given for not washing cars include the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean. Brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays, as the recent Easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners. However, one in four said they only did it as an excuse to get out of the house.\n\nCars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield and least likely in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are least often. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley said, \"A lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every Sunday. It was a national tradition. But let's face it, we don't have as much time anymore, the cars are bigger, and even the kids don't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either. On top of that, there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply.\"", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Mangu Ram, an 82-year-old Hindu refugee who fled to Kashmir during the partition of India in 1947, exemplifies the challenges faced by these refugees. Despite living in India for decades, WPRs are denied basic rights such as property ownership and voting in state elections, leaving them in abject poverty. The situation stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. However, there is hope for change with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist party, now sharing power in the state. Activists like Labha Ram Gandhi are advocating for state-subject rights for WPRs, warning of potential unrest if their demands are not met. The passage also highlights the broader context of unrest in Kashmir, including recent militant attacks, and the ongoing conflict over the region's status.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Previously commanding prices of up to £1.2 million, the breed is now being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skin turned into leather belts. This decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has made it less common for wealthy individuals to gift these dogs to officials. Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities have impacted the breed's popularity. The market collapse has also been exacerbated by unscrupulous breeding practices and the breed's unsuitability for urban living. Animal welfare workers recently rescued a group of mastiffs found in cramped cages on their way to a slaughterhouse, highlighting the cruel fate many of these dogs now face.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records of antibiotic prescriptions. They found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by the age of two, and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being overweight. Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics caused weight gain, but if they do, it may be because they kill off gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. The lead author warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age or repeatedly during infancy was associated with increased body mass in healthy children, and such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic. The study comes amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Living in poverty increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The study also found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment, or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. Household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. People who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims and perpetrators of crime. Gender was also identified as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behavior and lifestyles. The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government. The study's findings highlight a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risks of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. The study also found that the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. The findings suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighborhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. The Scottish government has a long-standing record of protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society and is tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives, including a £296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A pilot scheme in Cwm Cynon and Castell-nedd focuses on patients suspected of having cancer but showing no urgent signs or symptoms.

In Wales, there is concern that patients without clear symptoms may wait too long for a diagnosis, as they do not easily fit into a specific treatment pathway. This can result in multiple referrals and tests, taking several weeks. The fear is that many patients begin treatment only after their cancer has progressed.\n\nIn the pilot scheme, 40 doctors in Cwm Cynon can refer patients to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, within seven days. About six patients per week are expected to be seen and undergo various tests, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms in the Cwm Taf area receive a diagnosis. Doctors aim to diagnose a majority of patients with less obvious symptoms earlier. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board.\n\nThe trials, developed over the past 12 months following a visit by Welsh specialists to Aarhus, Denmark, aim to address concerns about Denmark's cancer survival rates.

The report also suggests retaining elements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) post-Brexit and adhering to scientific advice for quotas. Additionally, it raises concerns about the potential for four different fisheries management regimes in the UK. Despite these challenges, many in the fishing industry see Brexit as an opportunity for fairer shares and better management, as evidenced by the recent EU agreement on new quotas. The government has stated its aim to ensure British companies have maximum freedom to trade with the single market while reviewing fisheries management for sustainable stocks and fair access to quotas.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

While researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment, head teachers reported a positive impact, and there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged. The study also found that within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\" and about two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. The study suggests that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools, stating that they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and reflect the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He played a key role in accelerating the mapping of the human genome, which was completed in 2001. Despite facing criticism for his methods and commercial approach, his work has undeniably sped up the process of genomic research. After this achievement, he focused on creating synthetic life, leading to the development of an organism called Synthia, detailed in the journal Science.\n\nBorn in 1946, Dr. Venter's early life was marked by a lack of academic interest until he was drafted into the Vietnam War in 1967. His experiences as a naval orderly during the Tet offensive inspired him to pursue medicine and instilled in him a sense of urgency. Excelling in research during his medical training, he became involved in molecular biology and gene decoding. His innovative approach to gene sequencing, focusing on messenger RNA, allowed him to achieve unprecedented speeds in gene sequencing.\n\nIn 1995, he unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. In 1998, he announced the formation of Celera Genomics to decode the human genome in just three years, a task that the public project was aiming to complete in ten years. Both projects published their results in 2001. His commercial approach and disregard for traditional scientific conventions brought him both criticism and financial success.\n\nIn 2006, he founded the J. Craig Venter Institute, which spearheaded the creation of the world's first synthetic life form. Alongside this, he has conducted a genetic treasure hunt, collecting and sequencing microbes from the oceans to better understand gene evolution and function.

This security measure requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted mobile phone number or via Apple's Find My iPhone app, in addition to their username and password, when accessing their account from an unfamiliar device. If the code is not entered, access to iCloud is denied, and users are blocked from making purchases on iTunes, iBooks, or the App Store. However, users can regain access using a 14-character recovery key.\n\nPreviously, Apple's two-step verification did not apply to its backup service, allowing hackers to use tools like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker to download complete backups of user data. Apple's new implementation prevents this technique and notifies account owners via email when a backup is downloaded, regardless of whether two-factor authentication is enabled.\n\nSecurity experts have praised these changes but also raised concerns. Vladimir Katalov, owner of Elcomsoft, highlighted the risk of losing the recovery key and the potential for it to be stolen. On the other hand, Prof. Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey suggested that two-factor authentication should be the default setting for all major tech companies, not just Apple. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledged the need for greater awareness and plans to more aggressively encourage users to adopt stronger security measures.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Marcia's body was found 33 days after she disappeared. Ritter's then-husband advised her against seeing the body and the crime scene photos, but last year, Ritter asked to see the crime scene photos of her daughter's body and now says she wants revenge. Ritter viewed the photos on the laptop of Metro Police lead investigator Mickey Miller. She described her daughter's body as having a black mouth, a swollen face, vomit across her, hair pulled out in parts, and blood on her scalp. Ritter shouted, \"If I had a gun, I'd kill him!\" Marcia's body was found 150 yards from her home amid the clutter of a rarely used, windowless garage, under a shower curtain and a child's wading pool. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted, and her cookie money was missing. Cookies were scattered around the clothed body, and a neck bone was fractured. The case was Nashville's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years. In 1979, police charged a Trimble neighbor with the slaying, but prosecutors dropped the charges about a year later due to a lack of evidence. Barrett, 68, was living in Memphis when he was arrested in 2006. He was brought in after police matched the DNA on the murdered child's clothing to his. The match happened after he was arrested for the 1975 murder of Vanderbilt University student Sarah Vannatta Des Prez. Barrett had been in prison on sex charges between 1974 and 2002, except for about a year when Marcia disappeared. In 2009, he was found guilty of second-degree murder of Marcia, and a Davidson County Criminal Court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years.", "company": "ai21", "model_name": "jamba-1.6-large", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

O'Carroll, a former Open University information officer and key activist for PIE, attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation. Hacked Off, formed in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, is campaigning against what it sees as the \"biased and unfair\" Independent Press Standards Organisation and wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry. The news that O'Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group. PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalized and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL). The NCCL lobbied Parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child \"understood the nature of the act\" and apparently consented. The group also wanted incest to be legalized. O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee. The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for \"corrupting public morals.\" He wrote a blog after the February meeting, chaired by comedian John Cleese, confirming his attendance.

The study also reveals that three-quarters of women never wash their own car, with drivers more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt. The survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV found that 31% of men have never washed their own car, with only 12% of those that do saying they do it regularly. Meanwhile, only 5% of those surveyed said they had ever asked their children to wash the car as a way for them to earn extra pocket money.\n\nFactors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a Sunday and more live football on TV, meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend. The rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars. Other reasons given for not washing cars include the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean. Brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays, as the recent Easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners. However, one in four said they only did it as an excuse to get out of the house.\n\nCars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield and least likely in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are least often. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley said, \"A lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every Sunday. It was a national tradition. But let's face it, we don't have as much time anymore, the cars are bigger, and even the kids don't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either.
