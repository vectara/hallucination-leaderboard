Researchers suggest that antibiotics, similar to their use in farm animals, may contribute to weight gain in children. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, indicates that these drugs could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic. In England, a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds are overweight or obese. The Finnish study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as babies were more likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two further increasing the odds. Boys showed a higher propensity for weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that increased antibiotic use could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems. There is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Commission suggested that better integration of individual electoral registers managed by councils could help identify duplicate entries.

A record 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, with 68.7% turnout, the highest since 1997.

However, concerns over duplicate applications persisted, with an estimated 30-70% of applications in some areas being duplicates. The Commission called for clearer information on registration sites and a verification function, similar to those used in Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to inform people not to re-register if they had already voted, the issue remained unresolved. The Commission emphasized that voting twice in a general election is an offense punishable by an unlimited fine and called for a system to cross-check entries to reduce the risk of double voting.

They conducted a survey of 2,000 people to identify the top ten everyday emergencies, with the top issue being difficulty sleeping (46%). Design groups, including Makerversity, were tasked with creating products to alleviate these problems. Three prototypes were shortlisted: \n\n1. **Snooze** by Instruments: An alarm clock that connects to your phone and silences notifications to ensure a good night's sleep.\n2. **Forget Me Lock** by Onn Studio: A device that fastens on a key, swiveling green when the door is open and red when locked, providing reassurance about door security.\n3. **Nipper** by Impulse: The world's smallest mobile phone charger, which uses any household battery to provide a boost.\n\nThe public can vote for their favorite prototype on Twitter using the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign and developed into an actual product. Other prototypes that didn't make the final shortlist include a parking pin, a relay app for message forwarding when the phone dies, and a smart helmet with bone conduction headphones for cyclists.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers suggest that antibiotics, similar to their use in farm animals, may contribute to weight gain in children. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, indicates that these drugs could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic. In England, a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds are overweight or obese. The Finnish study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as babies were more likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two further increasing the odds. Boys showed a higher propensity for weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that increased antibiotic use could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems. There is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A jury heard that Costa was believed to be suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the murder. Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen examined Costa and testified that there was evidence of Costa's declining mental state both before and during the incident. Professor Mullen noted that Costa's erratic behavior, including fluctuating moods and a trail of faeces leading from the crime scene to the toilet, indicated a confused mental state.

Horwell noted that the use of polonium indicates Russian state involvement but did not implicate President Vladimir Putin directly. Litvinenko's defection to the UK and his criticisms of Putin were cited as possible motives. The public risk from polonium radiation in London remains uncertain, and Litvinenko was poisoned twice before his death.

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, transformed the mapping of the human genome into a competitive race, leading to vilification by the scientific community. Despite his controversial methods and self-proclaimed achievements, his work significantly accelerated the genome mapping process. After the human genome's publication, he focused on creating a synthetic life form, culminating in the development of Synthia, detailed in the journal Science. Born in 1946, Venter's early life included a stint in Vietnam that inspired his medical career. His research excellence led him to the US National Institute of Health, where he pioneered automated gene decoding. Venter's breakthrough in focusing on RNA molecules allowed unprecedented gene sequencing rates. Criticized by James Watson, Venter left NIH to establish The Institute for Genomic Research, unveiling the first complete genome of a free-living organism in 1995. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome, competing with a public project. Both projects published results in 2001, despite Venter's controversial methods. In 2006, he formed the J. Craig Venter Institute to create the first synthetic life form, while also conducting a genetic treasure hunt on his yacht, Sorcerer II. Venter's synthetic life breakthrough, though controversial, aims to revolutionize industry by producing cells that could reduce oil dependency and capture carbon dioxide.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

After surgery, cancer cells are sent to a lab for screening, and results indicating a low risk (as low as 5%) can be provided within days. This risk assessment is comparable to or better than the outcomes of chemotherapy, which has severe side effects. Most breast cancer patients currently undergo chemotherapy post-surgery to prevent recurrence, but these new tests, such as EndoPredict, may show that chemotherapy is unnecessary for some. These tests are currently available privately at a cost of about Â£2,500, but there is hope they will be adopted by the NHS. Experts argue that the cost of these tests could be offset by savings from avoiding chemotherapy.

The harassment often goes unreported and forces women to alter their daily routines to avoid confrontation, effectively excluding them from public spaces. The findings prompted calls for a campaign to address sexist and threatening behavior on buses and trains, emphasizing the need for women to recognize and report such incidents and for aggressors and witnesses to be aware of the severity of their actions.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
