Researchers suggest that antibiotics, similar to their use in farm animals, may contribute to weight gain in children. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, indicates that these drugs could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic. In England, a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds are overweight or obese. The Finnish study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as babies were more likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two further increasing the odds. Boys showed a higher propensity for weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that increased antibiotic use could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems. There is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Stiviano argued that there was nothing wrong with receiving gifts from Donald Sterling and denied taking advantage of him. The court decision was celebrated by Shelly Sterling, with her attorney stating it sets a precedent for injured spouses to recover damages from recipients of ill-begotten gifts. Donald Sterling's racist remarks, including objections to Stiviano associating with African-Americans, led to his NBA ban, fine, and loss of ownership rights in the Los Angeles Clippers.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Historically, only two other First Ladies, Martha Washington and Anna Harrison, did not reside in the White House during their husbands' presidencies. The passage notes that Melania's decision aligns with her focus on Barron, as she has previously prioritized his care over public duties. It also highlights that other presidential families have managed similar situations, with some children moving to the White House immediately after their fathers' inaugurations. The role of the First Lady, traditionally ceremonial, has evolved over time with some, like Michelle Obama, taking on more active public roles. The passage suggests that Melania may not fully embrace the traditional First Lady role, with her primary focus being on Barron.

Oophorectomy was associated with a 62% reduction in breast cancer death for BRCA1 carriers but not for BRCA2 carriers. The procedure also led to a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was immediate and lasted for 15 years. The study authors called for further research, particularly on BRCA2 carriers and those who undergo oophorectomy within a year of diagnosis.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In a recent TED talk, she explained that she also uses 'short' and 'wife' to describe herself, emphasizing that these are just factual descriptors. Lillian argues that 'fat' doesn't have to be synonymous with 'ugly' and criticizes societal programming that leads women to deny their size. She highlighted that size discrimination in the workplace has increased by 66% over the past 30 years and that young girls often wish to be thinner. However, she cites studies showing that increased exposure to body diversity leads to greater acceptance and preference for different body types, which motivates her burlesque performances. Lillian, who weighs 240 lbs, began performing in 2012 and finds it empowering. Her TED talk, posted on YouTube three weeks ago, has received nearly 38,000 views and mostly positive feedback, including messages from viewers who felt inspired by her message.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers suggest that antibiotics, similar to their use in farm animals, may contribute to weight gain in children. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, indicates that these drugs could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic. In England, a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds are overweight or obese. The Finnish study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as babies were more likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two further increasing the odds. Boys showed a higher propensity for weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that increased antibiotic use could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems. There is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The thief is believed to have broken the rear right passenger-side window, used a rope to pull the rifle case out, and possibly employed another vehicle to create momentum.

The alleged crime involved stomping on Freebody's head, cutting his throat, and stabbing him multiple times. A jury heard that Costa was believed to be suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the murder. Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen examined Costa and testified that there was evidence of Costa's declining mental state both before and during the incident. Professor Mullen noted that Costa's erratic behavior, including fluctuating moods and a trail of faeces leading from the crime scene to the toilet, indicated a confused mental state. The prosecution argued that Costa may have feigned memory issues during his examination, but Professor Mullen denied this. The case hinges on whether Costa's unstable mindset at the time of the attack can be proven, as this could result in a not guilty verdict.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Half of the parents surveyed reported that their children requested to have school-tried foods cooked at home. The most popular vegetables among children were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, while aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. The survey aimed to address concerns raised by a previous Mumsnet survey, which suggested some parents opted for packed lunches due to their children's perceived fussiness. The findings indicate that school meals can help children try new foods and increase dietary variety, with school meals in England now adhering to strict nutritional guidelines. Approximately four in ten primary school children in England eat school lunches, a slightly higher proportion than in secondary schools, while about 46% of children in Scotland eat school lunches.

Prime Minister David Cameron urged First Great Western (FGW) to review its decision to nearly double some fares on the London to Cotswolds route, which passes through his Witney constituency. Cameron and Labour had promised to freeze fares and cap price hikes, respectively. FGW's planned 87% increase on an off-peak return from Charlbury to London, from £33.30 to £62.40, angered constituents and prompted Cameron's intervention. Train companies can increase unregulated fares, which make up about half of their revenue, three times a year. FGW claimed the hike aligned the North Cotswolds route with other services and offered cheaper advanced single tickets. Other notable hikes included a 24.5% increase on an anytime return between Stafford and Liverpool with Virgin, and a 22% increase on a first-class day return from Manchester to Stoke with Virgin. Virgin defended its hikes, stating most affected cheaper Virgin-only fares and that its overall increase was below the industry average.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

After surgery, cancer cells are sent to a lab for screening, and results indicating a low risk (as low as 5%) can be provided within days. This risk assessment is comparable to or better than the outcomes of chemotherapy, which has severe side effects. Most breast cancer patients currently undergo chemotherapy post-surgery to prevent recurrence, but these new tests, such as EndoPredict, may show that chemotherapy is unnecessary for some.

The incident occurred in the basement of a house in Mayfair, Philadelphia, where Valecce had been staying. The ringleader, Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, believed Valecce had harmed his cat and stolen money and drugs. Campbell, along with his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, carried out the assault, which was filmed and later presented in court. Valecce suffered severe injuries including three busted ribs, two broken wrists, and facial fractures. He managed to escape and contact the police. Campbell and Halin were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, while Ng received a 23-month sentence. Two other defendants, David Thomas and Jennifer Pratt, are awaiting sentencing and trial, respectively.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season, is also being pursued by other top European clubs including Paris Saint-Germain. PSV's technical director, Marcel Brands, confirmed the interest and noted that Depay's value has increased since Tottenham's £15 million offer was rejected last summer. Depay, born in 1994, started his career at PSV and has been compared to Dutch star Arjen Robben and even considered better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo by some scouts.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that the number of times Britons are having sex has been decreasing since the advent of the internet. According to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives due to constant connectivity, such as checking emails, which reduces quiet, empty time. He also notes that more people living alone and the erosion of boundaries between home, work, and the outside world contribute to this trend. Catherine Mercer, a researcher, adds that competing demands on time and staying connected late into the evening make sex a lower priority.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in major cities have impacted their popularity. The breed's over-commercialization, including cross-breeding for profit, has led to a glut of poor-quality dogs. Urbanization has also made people realize that Tibetan mastiffs are not well-suited to city living.
