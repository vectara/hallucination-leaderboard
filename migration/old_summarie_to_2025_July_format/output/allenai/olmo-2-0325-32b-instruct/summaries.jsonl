The researchers suggest that antibiotics, which are used to make farm animals put on weight, may also be fattening our children. The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year olds with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but it suggested that if they do, it may be because they kill off bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. The lead author, Dr Antti Saari, warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. He suggested that such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlighted the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The passage also mentions that the worldwide obesity epidemic is more pronounced for boys and that an increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The over-prescription of antibiotics is a concern, as it may lead to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This money could be used to build 80,000 to 170,000 new social homes, creating the largest social house building programme since the 1970s. The report argues that social housing would still exist in expensive areas, but there would be less of it. The government's Downing Street backs the report, stating that councils should use their social housing stock efficiently and selling high-value housing to invest in more social housing is something they should consider. The Labour party, however, criticizes the proposal, saying it would drive out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods and break up mixed communities. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey suggests using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes instead. The report states that expensive social housing accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, and about 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant each year. The government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £4.5bn after paying off the debt. Critics argue that such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, creating segregated communities.

Poorer young people were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. The study also showed that household poverty increased the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors were considered. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, but girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The findings suggest a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can inadvertently reproduce conditions that foster violence. The study also found that the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefited areas with the most chronic rates of crime, with half of the communities with the highest crime rates found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. The Scottish government has stated that Scotland is becoming a safer place to live, with recorded crime at a 41-year low, and they are tackling poverty and inequalities through various initiatives.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old, are large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" that were concealed by rainforest until deforestation revealed more than 450 of them. The function of these sites is not well understood, but they are unlikely to be villages due to the lack of artifacts and their non-defensive layout. Instead, they are thought to have been used sporadically for ritual gatherings, similar to Stonehenge or Maya pyramids.\n\nDr. Neil Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs and found that they were built among taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy. This raises questions about their purpose. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems before European arrival, but rather had been influenced by humans who concentrated on economically valuable trees like palms, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.

The fishing industry, which voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU, hopes to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords warn that the UK may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. The fishing industry contributes a small percentage to the UK's GDP and employs around 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority in the wider Brexit negotiations. The Lords emphasize that the industry should not be marginalized. The UK's fishing industry relies on market access to the EU, as it exports the majority of its fish to the EU and imports a significant portion of its fish from EU states. The report suggests that continued market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The Lords also recommend retaining certain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing total allowable catches on scientific advice. The UK will continue to be under international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states. There is concern that leaving the EU could lead to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.

The Russian embassy said the convoys allowed Russian soldiers to defeat the Germans on the Eastern Front. The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognized. The Foreign Office allowed an \"exception to the rules\" last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013. The Ushakov medal is awarded to sailors who have displayed courage in the course of defending Russia or its interests. Mr Lewis, like many of his colleagues, did not see himself as a hero, but as someone who was \"simply doing his bit for the war effort.\" The Arctic Convoys consisted of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to resupply the Soviet Union during World War II. They faced constant threats of attack by German U-boats and aircraft, as well as severe cold, storms, and ice floes. By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels, and thousands of Allied seamen lost their lives.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Born in 1946, Dr. Venter initially pursued surfing before being drafted into the Vietnam War, which inspired him to become a doctor and instilled a sense of urgency in his work. During his medical training, he excelled in research and developed a method to sequence genes more efficiently. This led to his departure from the NIH in 1992 to establish a private research institute. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome in three years, competing with the public project. Both projects published their results in 2001. Dr. Venter's disregard for scientific conventions brought him criticism but also financial success, allowing him to pursue his interests without traditional funding. He later formed the J Craig Venter Institute and worked on creating synthetic life, which he announced as a breakthrough. He also collected marine life forms for genetic sequencing.

The report warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords say these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations due to the small contribution of the fishing industry to the UK's GDP and employment. The UK fishing industry produces only 0.5% of GDP and employs 12,000 fishers.\n\nThe report highlights that the UK's fishing industry needs continued market access to the EU, as the majority of UK fish are exported to the EU, while a significant proportion of fish consumed in Britain is imported, often from EU states. The Lords suggest that market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The report also recommends retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as total allowable catches and quotas based on scientific advice, and continuing international cooperation with neighboring states.\n\nThe Lords are concerned that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework will fall away, potentially leading to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these concerns, many in the fishing industry believe Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats, expecting fairer shares in catching opportunities and better fisheries management outside the EU.\n\nThe government has stated that it aims to ensure maximum freedom for British companies to trade with and operate in the single market while reviewing fisheries management to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In 2001, both Dr. Venter's private company and the public project published their results of the human genome.

The current freeholder is thought to be the Welcome Trust, and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them, which could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million for a 90-year lease. The estate agents have noted that properties with such short leases rarely come on the market, and the phone has not stopped ringing with interest.

He was one of the worst players on the pitch during Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday. Despite a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, his form has significantly dipped. Fabregas spoke of his happiness in London earlier this week, but his form has raised questions about his durability. He was given a four out of ten by a Spanish newspaper for his performance against Holland. Fabregas has been playing almost every minute of every match, which has led to fatigue. His role as a key man in Chelsea's title charge has declined of late. Jose Mourinho will be concerned about Fabregas's toil in the midfield during the full 90 minutes against Holland. Fabregas captained Spain but struggled to make an impact. After his £30 million transfer to Chelsea, his former club Barcelona released a statement pointing out his traditional post-Christmas slump. Despite glowing starts to each campaign, his contributions decreased as each season drew to a close. Fabregas had 15 Premier League assists by mid-January but has only one in five games since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. He was on track to break Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists in a season but now looks set to fall short. Chelsea have six opponents left who Fabregas has assisted goals against this season. Fabregas's personal accolade is important, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again, the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks.

The researchers suggest that antibiotics, which are used to make farm animals put on weight, may also be fattening our children. The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year olds with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but it suggested that if they do, it may be because they kill off bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. The lead author, Dr Antti Saari, warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. He suggested that such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlighted the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The passage also mentions that the worldwide obesity epidemic is more pronounced for boys and that an increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The over-prescription of antibiotics is a concern, as it may lead to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The fish initially moves away but returns to be massaged and seems to enjoy the sensation. The fish swims off and returns multiple times to be stroked. Giroux notes that the fish used to share its tank with two other fish but had to be separated due to bullying. He then began feeding the fish by hand and noticed it becoming more sociable. The fish now enjoys being stroked and becomes frustrated if Giroux doesn't play with it daily. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid, first bred in Taiwan around 1986.

A sharp instrument, particularly a knife, remained the most common method of killing in Scotland, accounting for 51% of homicides (29 cases). Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. The majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, but 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson commented on the continued falls in homicide cases and the long-term decline in violent crime, emphasizing the need for continued efforts through education and enforcement. Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker expressed caution about the statistics, noting that last year's \"record low\" figures were later revised upwards to show an increase, and highlighted the rise in sexual and violent crimes.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This money could be used to build 80,000 to 170,000 new social homes, creating the largest social house building programme since the 1970s. The report argues that social housing would still exist in expensive areas, but there would be less of it. The government's Downing Street backs the report, stating that councils should use their social housing stock efficiently and selling high-value housing to invest in more social housing is something they should consider. The Labour party, however, criticizes the proposal, saying it would drive out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods and break up mixed communities. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey suggests using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes instead. The report states that expensive social housing accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, and about 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant each year. The government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £4.5bn after paying off the debt. Critics argue that such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, creating segregated communities. Housing Minister Grant Shapps defends the government's position, stating that they have introduced reforms to get Britain building and reduce social housing waiting lists.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The agency makes money by charging housing benefit for each person housed in a property, rather than the property itself, leading to higher benefit payouts than the rent paid to the property's landlord. Both organizations are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. The relationship between the charity and the letting agency has been criticized by a homeless group as \"a new low\". Records show that Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who later set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The charity's stated goal is to help ex-offenders and reduce poverty, sickness, and distress. Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture profitable. In one example, the company was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants, while the property owner received £1,150 per month. The agency focuses on housing single homeless men over the age of 35, despite legislation allowing for private accommodation for this age group. Tenants have reported unsuitable living conditions, including lack of heating, hot water, rats, and damp. One tenant, Nigel McCann, described having to remove 28 bags of rubbish from a house to make it habitable. Wandsworth Council has paid Investing Solutions more than £2.1m over the past two years. The council has a team to ensure the private rented sector is safe, secure, and affordable. Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, criticized the relationship between the charity and the letting agency. Samir Patel defended Fresh Start Housing as an independent charity with its own board of trustees and stated that the majority of rents are passed to private landlords. Fresh Start Housing has housed 788 homeless people since its founding and 222 in the last 12 months. The Department for Communities and Local Government stated that local authorities are responsible for safeguarding taxpayers' money through dedicated investigations and inspections.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Fleet Street was once the heart of British journalism, with nearly every national newspaper having offices within a half-mile radius. The first British daily newspaper was published in Fleet Street in 1702. The area was famous for its many bars and pubs, and was known as the \"Street of Shame.\" The departure of the last two journalists from Fleet Street marks the end of an era. The decline of Fleet Street began in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his newspapers to Wapping, leading to a year-long dispute with unions. The move to computerised printing technology and other parts of London contributed to the decline. Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith reflect on the history and atmosphere of Fleet Street, with Sherriff recalling his first day in a smoke-filled newsroom and Smith sharing a story about a tour guide who mistakenly announced the end of journalism in Fleet Street.

Living in poverty also increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The research, part of the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, tracked 4,300 young people since 1998. It found that a history of trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment, or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. The study also showed that household poverty increased the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors were considered. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, but girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The findings suggest a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can inadvertently reproduce conditions that foster violence. The study also found that the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefited areas with the most chronic rates of crime, with half of the communities with the highest crime rates found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.

The earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old, are large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" that were concealed by rainforest until deforestation revealed more than 450 of them.

Instead, they are thought to have been used sporadically for ritual gatherings, similar to Stonehenge or Maya pyramids.\n\nDr. Neil Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs and found that they were built among taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy. This raises questions about their purpose. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems before European arrival, but rather had been influenced by humans who concentrated on economically valuable trees like palms, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.

The fishing industry, which voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU, hopes to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords warn that the UK may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. The fishing industry contributes a small percentage to the UK's GDP and employs around 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority in the wider Brexit negotiations. The Lords emphasize that the industry should not be marginalized. The UK's fishing industry relies on market access to the EU, as it exports the majority of its fish to the EU and imports a significant portion of its fish from EU states. The report suggests that continued market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The Lords also recommend retaining certain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing total allowable catches on scientific advice. The UK will continue to be under international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states. There is concern that leaving the EU could lead to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.

The report warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords say these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations due to the small contribution of the fishing industry to the UK's GDP and employment. The UK fishing industry produces only 0.5% of GDP and employs 12,000 fishers.\n\nThe report highlights that the UK's fishing industry needs continued market access to the EU, as the majority of UK fish are exported to the EU, while a significant proportion of fish consumed in Britain is imported, often from EU states. The Lords suggest that market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The report also recommends retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as total allowable catches and quotas based on scientific advice, and continuing international cooperation with neighboring states.\n\nThe Lords are concerned that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework will fall away, potentially leading to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these concerns, many in the fishing industry believe Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats, expecting fairer shares in catching opportunities and better fisheries management outside the EU.\n\nThe government has stated that it aims to ensure maximum freedom for British companies to trade with and operate in the single market while reviewing fisheries management to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study found that women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate among men. The increases in excessive drinking are attributed to changing social norms, the influx of affluent young people in cities, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study also noted that alcohol advertising has increased and taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index, making alcohol cheaper in real dollars.

The new kit features an all-white branding and an all-new style of collar. Liverpool's focus is on the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley next weekend. The shirt also pays tribute to the Hillsborough disaster with a memorial flame and the number 96. Liverpool legends Robbie Fowler and Ian Rush attended the launch. Sterling recently rejected a £100,000-a-week contract, sparking speculation about his future, but Liverpool are adamant he will stay.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This map is the first in a series that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device, and the 13ft (four meters) Victor M. Blanco Telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The map shows clumps of dark matter, with red indicating more dark matter and blue indicating less. The goal is to map 12.5% of the sky over five years. The map was released at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland. Dark matter, which makes up at least 80% of the matter in the known universe, cannot be directly observed but its gravitational effects on galaxies can be studied. The map covers 0.4% of the sky, with the moon shown for scale. The project, part of the Dark Energy Survey, aims to study how galaxies formed in the universe and to probe the nature of dark energy. The team at Manchester analyzed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to create the map, a process that requires significant computing power. The survey will continue until 2018, providing more insights into the distribution of dark matter and its role in the universe.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "olmo-2-0325-32b-instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
