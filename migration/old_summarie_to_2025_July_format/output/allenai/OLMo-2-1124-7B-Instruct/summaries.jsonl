Last year, £3.6 billion was spent on agency staff, and NHS Improvement aims to cut this figure by £1 billion by the end of the current financial year.

The goal is to reduce the overall cost of agency staff and decrease the NHS's reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS must cover agency fees and employer costs. Despite the progress, NHS Improvement states that the NHS is still short of its target, with the latest accounts showing NHS trusts being 10% down on their desired financial position. The passage also mentions that while the agency bill is decreasing, it is unclear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has increased.

Serco Northlink had offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined.

Varvara swam approximately 14,000 miles from her feeding grounds off Russia's Sakhalin Island across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast of the United States, ending her journey in Baja, Mexico. This journey surpassed the previous record held by a humpback whale that made a round trip of 10,190 miles. The significance of Varvara's trip is not only in the distance covered but also in her visit to three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales, which was unexpected. This discovery suggests that some western gray whales might actually be eastern grays, which could have implications for the conservation status of the western gray whale, which is believed to number around 150 individuals. The ability of Varvara to navigate such vast distances is noted as impressive and could lead researchers to reevaluate the genetic differentiation between eastern and western gray whales.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The judge's decision was celebrated by Shelly Sterling's lawyer, who stated it was a victory for the Sterling family and set a precedent for recovering damages from the recipient of such gifts. The incident began when an audio recording surfaced of Sterling making racist comments to Stiviano about African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. This led to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banning Sterling from the league and fining him $2.5 million. The ruling against Stiviano was based on the fact that the gifts were considered ill-gotten gains.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The increases in drinking patterns are attributed to changing social norms, where women are increasingly engaging in binge drinking to catch up with men.

The cost of a planned caesarean in the NHS is significantly higher than that of a natural birth. The passage contrasts WHO's stance with current NHS guidelines, which allow for caesareans without medical justification, including for women with tokophobia (extreme fear of childbirth) and other conditions.

According to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, the typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. He attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives, with people constantly checking their emails and being connected to work and social activities. The professor also mentions that more people living alone might be a factor, but he emphasizes that the busier lives caused by technological advancements and the blurring of home, work, and outside world boundaries are the more realistic explanations for the decrease in sexual activity. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, is quoted as saying that with an increasing number of competing demands on time, sex often falls down the list of priorities. The passage concludes by noting that late-night work emails can further prevent couples from focusing on each other at bedtime.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It highlights several factors contributing to this decline:\n\n1. **Anti-Corruption Campaign**: The Chinese government's anti-corruption drive has made it less acceptable for wealthy businessmen to give these dogs as gifts to officials, which was a common practice in the past.\n\n2. **Bans on Large Dogs**: Several Chinese cities have implemented bans on owning dogs over 50 kg, which includes Tibetan Mastiffs. This has significantly impacted their popularity.\n\n3. **Market Glut**: There is an oversupply of poorly bred Tibetan Mastiffs due to some breeders prioritizing profit over quality, leading to a decline in the breed's overall value and desirability.\n\n4. **Animal Welfare Concerns**: The passage describes a shocking incident where 20 Tibetan Mastiffs were found in poor condition on their way to a slaughterhouse, highlighting the cruelty some dogs face.\n\n5. **Historical Role and Appearance**: Originally used for herding in Tibet, Tibetan Mastiffs are known for their loyalty and distinctive appearance.\n\n6. **Urbanization**: The rapid urbanization in China has made people realize that", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The top emergency identified in a survey of 2,000 people was not being able to sleep, leading to the creation of \"snooze,\" an alarm clock that silences phone notifications to ensure a good night's sleep. Another product, \"Forget Me Lock,\" is designed to alleviate the stress of forgetting whether you locked your front door. It fastens on the key and changes color from green (open) to red (locked) when the key is turned in a lock. The third product, \"Nipper,\" is a small mobile phone charger that can use any household battery as its energy source.\n\nThe competition is being decided through a Twitter retweet contest, with the product that receives the most retweets by April 40 moving forward to a Kickstarter campaign for development. The passage highlights the innovative solutions created by designers and the potential impact of these products on daily life, showcasing the collaborative effort between Direct Line and design companies like Makerversity.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n\n1.

These debates, particularly those in Freeport, Quincy, and Alton, drew large crowds from neighboring states due to the significant national importance of the slavery issue. The Freeport Doctrine was Douglas's response to the Dred Scott decision, which held that Congress could not ban slavery in the territories. Douglas proposed that even if the Supreme Court ruled that slaves were property that could be taken into the territories, it would still be up to the territorial legislatures to pass laws that would allow or prohibit slavery based on the local climate and conditions. This doctrine emphasized the role of popular sovereignty in determining the status of slavery in the territories, a stance that aimed to appeal to both pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions by allowing them to decide the issue democratically.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The scheme focuses on family doctors who examine patients with cancer symptoms but no clear signs. The initiative was prompted by a visit to Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer detection rates. The concern in Wales is the delay in diagnosis due to a lack of clear symptoms, leading to a lengthy process where family doctors refer patients back and forth for various tests. The pilot aims to streamline this process by having family doctors refer suspicious cases directly to Cardiff University Hospital, Llantrisant, within seven days. The plan involves seeing up to 40 suspected cases per week and providing various tests. Currently, only 35% of suspicious cases in the Cwm Taf area receive a diagnosis. The initiative also includes setting up a similar clinic in Port Talbot Hospital as part of a broader screening program by the South Wales Valleys Health Board. The scheme was developed over 12 months following a visit to Denmark, which had established diagnostic centers due to concerns about cancer detection rates.

Half of the women interviewed reported being harassed before they were 18 years old. The harassment ranged from insults and persistent flirting to physical attacks and rape. The survey revealed that six out of ten women are afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men. This fear leads women to alter their daily routines, clothing, and schedules to avoid confrontation. The harassment limits women's freedom and excludes them from the public arena.\n\nThe high council for gender equality, which compiled the report, was surprised by the extent of the problem. The findings led to calls for a campaign to combat sexist or threatening behavior on buses and trains. The council emphasized that women should be able to move freely in public spaces without fear.\n\nErnestine Ronai, a council member, pointed out that attackers believe they can act with impunity, often hiding in crowds to escape consequences.

He attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives, with people constantly checking their emails and being connected to work and social activities. The professor also mentions that more people living alone might be a factor, but he emphasizes that the busier lives caused by technological advancements and the blurring of home, work, and outside world boundaries are the more realistic explanations for the decrease in sexual activity.

In a column published in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard expressed the profound impact the loss of their son Martin and the injuries to their daughter Jane have had on their family. They emphasize their understanding of the heinous nature of Tsarnaev's crimes, as they lived through the traumatic event. Despite this, they argue that the pursuit of the death penalty could prolong the pain and suffering they and their remaining children have endured. They advocate for life imprisonment without the possibility of release for Tsarnaev, along with the waiver of all his rights to appeal, as a means to bring closure to their family and to the community. The Richards stress that their opinion on the death penalty is personal and not representative of any broader stance. They hope that by ending the pursuit of the death penalty, they can move towards a better future for themselves and", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The plan was for Phillips to go one way and Crowley another, but Phillips ran towards the cliff and fell to his death. The taxi driver, Dave Sidaway, stated he would not have left Phillips if he knew where they were. The inquest concluded with a verdict of accidental death, noting that there was no evidence Phillips knew the danger he was in due to the darkness and his disorientation. Jacob Phillips was found dead the next day by a dog walker on the rocky beach at the base of the cliff.

This move came after a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and was made ahead of a speech by US Secretary of State John Kerry on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution, passed on Friday, stated that settlements are illegal under international law and a major obstacle to peace. Israel, particularly angered by the condemnation of East Jerusalem, responded by recalling its ambassadors, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had planned to vote on new settlement homes but postponed the vote at the request of the Prime Minister's office to avoid further straining relations with Washington before Kerry's speech. Kerry is expected to present his vision for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict and address criticisms of the Obama administration's stance on Israel. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas sees the resolution as paving the way for an upcoming peace conference in France on January 15. Abbas hopes the conference will establish a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-7B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
