The study, conducted by Finnish researchers and published in the journal Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics may contribute to weight gain in children similarly to how they are used to fatten farm animals. The researchers emphasize the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy due to the potential impact on childhood obesity rates, which are notably higher among boys. The study does not prove causation but highlights a correlation between antibiotic use and weight gain, suggesting that the alteration of gut bacteria by antibiotics could lead to increased food absorption and appetite.

The current situation is highlighted by the fact that only 36.8% of Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection. The letter from the former managers emphasizes that while England has produced talented young players like Barkley, Sterling, and Kane, they lack the opportunity to play at the top level. They argue that increasing the number of home-grown players will provide these young talents with the necessary opportunities to develop and compete on the world stage.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The match was played at Anfield and featured intense emotion, drama, and excitement, with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Dortmund's former coach Thomas Tuchel present. The game was reminiscent of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League win against AC Milan, where they came back from a 3-0 deficit to win. Liverpool needed three goals after Dortmund took a 2-0 lead, and they managed to turn the game around with goals from Divock Origi, Philippe Coutinho, and Mamadou Sakho, before Lovren's late winner.

The study also noted that the procedure was most effective when performed within two years of breast cancer diagnosis, with a 73% reduction in death risk for BRCA1 carriers.

Despite being born in India and living there for multiple generations, these refugees have been denied basic citizenship rights such as owning property, voting in state elections, and working for the state government. The denial of these rights has kept them in abject poverty. The situation has persisted due to fears from the state government of upsetting the demographic balance between Hindus and Muslims in India's only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir. However, with the recent election success of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, there is hope for change. The BJP is expected to champion the cause of the WPRs, potentially leading to the granting of citizenship rights and an improvement in their living conditions.

Brown is determined not to rush his return, learning from the experiences of other players like George North and Johnny Sexton who have suffered multiple concussions. He emphasizes the importance of being aware of concussion symptoms and the necessity of not playing through them, a lesson he learned from World Rugby's online modules. Brown aims to return to action gradually, starting with a 20-minute bike ride to assess his recovery. He highlights the significance of prioritizing health over competition, a message reinforced by Land Rover's \"We Deal in Real\" campaign, which he supports.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The crackdown on corruption has led to a decline in the gifting of these dogs to officials, and the ban on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities has further reduced their appeal. As a result, many Tibetan mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare groups have rescued some dogs destined for slaughter, highlighting the cruel fate of these once-prized animals. The situation has also led to an increase in theft of the dogs by gangs and the offloading of 'imperfect' specimens by breeders to abattoirs. The decline in the breed's quality due to profit-driven cross-breeding has exacerbated the problem. The combination of urbanization and changing attitudes towards large dogs as unsuitable for city living has contributed to the Tibetan mastiff's fall from grace.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The competition was part of a design makeathon where groups were tasked with creating products to solve common everyday problems. The top three finalists are:\n\n1. **Forget Me Lock**: A device that attaches to your key and changes color to indicate whether your door is locked or open. This helps alleviate the stress of forgetting if you've locked your door.\n\n2. **Snooze**: An alarm clock that connects to your phone and silences notifications to ensure a good night's sleep. This addresses the issue of being disturbed by phone notifications while trying to sleep.\n\n3. **Nipper**: A tiny mobile phone charger that uses household batteries as a power source. It's designed for people who run out of battery while out and about.\n\nParticipants can vote for their favorite product on Twitter using the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will go into a Kickstarter campaign to fund its development.

He excelled in research rather than medical practice and was pivotal in the early days of molecular biology. His introduction of automated decoding machines and his shift to studying RNA accelerated gene sequencing.\n\nHis most notable achievements include:\n\n1. The first complete genome sequence of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae.\n2. The formation of Celera Genomics to compete with the public Human Genome Project, leading to the simultaneous publication of the human genome sequence in 2001.\n3. The establishment of the J.

Four out of five children who ate school lunches tried new foods there. Half of the parents surveyed reported that their children requested these new foods to be prepared at home as well. The survey involved about 1,000 parents, and it highlighted that carrots, sweetcorn, and peas were the most popular vegetables among children, while aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. The research was prompted by concerns from parents who believed their children were too fussy to eat school lunches. Rob Rees, the Trust chairman, emphasized the role of school meals in expanding children's diets. Carrie Longton, co-founder of Mumsnet, noted that school meals have improved and that peer pressure can encourage children to eat more healthily at school. The article also mentions that school meals in England must adhere to strict nutritional guidelines and that more primary school children than secondary school children eat school lunches.

This is his first win despite being shortlisted in 1991 and making the longlist on three other occasions. The painting, which depicts a leper squint, is part of a series Simpson has been working on. The relatively small size of \"Squint (19)\" contributed to its selection for the competition. The prize money of £25,000 will be used by Simpson to purchase materials for his art. Ansel Krut, one of the judges, described the painting as \"quite extraordinary\" and likened it to a \"tone poem\" that evokes sympathy due to its subject matter. The John Moores Painting Prize, established in 1957, is one of Britain's oldest art awards, with notable past winners including David Hockney and Peter Doig.

The forecast predicts varying weather conditions across different parts of New South Wales, with Sydney expected to experience showers and a chance of late showers, while Newcastle and surrounding areas are predicted to have showers and possible late showers. The Bureau of Meteorology suggests that the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the state's northeast, including the Northern Rivers and Mid North Coast, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. The SES will continue its clean-up efforts and warn residents to prepare their homes for potential severe weather.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The crackdown on corruption has led to a decline in the gifting of these dogs to officials, and the ban on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities has further reduced their appeal. As a result, many Tibetan mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare groups have rescued some dogs destined for slaughter, highlighting the cruel fate of these once-prized animals. The situation has also led to an increase in theft of the dogs by gangs and the offloading of 'imperfect' specimens by breeders to abattoirs. The decline in the breed's quality due to profit-driven cross-breeding has exacerbated the problem.
