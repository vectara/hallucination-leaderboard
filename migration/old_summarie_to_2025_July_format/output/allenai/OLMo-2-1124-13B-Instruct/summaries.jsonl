The study, conducted by Finnish researchers and published in the journal Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics may contribute to weight gain in children similarly to how they are used to fatten farm animals. The researchers emphasize the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy due to the potential impact on childhood obesity rates, which are notably higher among boys. The study does not prove causation but highlights a correlation between antibiotic use and weight gain, suggesting that the alteration of gut bacteria by antibiotics could lead to increased food absorption and appetite.

The current situation is highlighted by the fact that only 36.8% of Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection. The letter from the former managers emphasizes that while England has produced talented young players like Barkley, Sterling, and Kane, they lack the opportunity to play at the top level. They argue that increasing the number of home-grown players will provide these young talents with the necessary opportunities to develop and compete on the world stage.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study, conducted in Canada, analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. It found that women who underwent an oophorectomy (ovary removal) after their breast cancer diagnosis experienced a 62% reduction in breast cancer death if they had the BRCA1 mutation. No such reduction was observed in those with the BRCA2 mutation. The protective effect of the surgery was immediate and lasted for 15 years. The study also noted that the procedure was most effective when performed within two years of breast cancer diagnosis, with a 73% reduction in death risk for BRCA1 carriers. The authors of the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology, suggest that oophorectomy should be considered as part of the treatment discussion for BRCA mutation carriers diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.

Despite being born in India and living there for multiple generations, these refugees have been denied basic citizenship rights such as owning property, voting in state elections, and working for the state government. The denial of these rights has kept them in abject poverty. The situation has persisted due to fears from the state government of upsetting the demographic balance between Hindus and Muslims in India's only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir. However, with the recent election success of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, there is hope for change. The BJP is expected to champion the cause of the WPRs, potentially leading to the granting of citizenship rights and an improvement in their living conditions.

He withdrew from Harlequins' match against Saracens at Wembley last weekend due to the lingering effects of a concussion sustained after the game against France. Brown is determined not to rush his return, learning from the experiences of other players like George North and Johnny Sexton who have suffered multiple concussions. He emphasizes the importance of being aware of concussion symptoms and the necessity of not playing through them, a lesson he learned from World Rugby's online modules. Brown aims to return to action gradually, starting with a 20-minute bike ride to assess his recovery. He highlights the significance of prioritizing health over competition, a message reinforced by Land Rover's \"We Deal in Real\" campaign, which he supports.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The crackdown on corruption has led to a decline in the gifting of these dogs to officials, and the ban on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities has further reduced their appeal. As a result, many Tibetan mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare groups have rescued some dogs destined for slaughter, highlighting the cruel fate of these once-prized animals. The situation has also led to an increase in theft of the dogs by gangs and the offloading of 'imperfect' specimens by breeders to abattoirs. The decline in the breed's quality due to profit-driven cross-breeding has exacerbated the problem. The combination of urbanization and changing attitudes towards large dogs as unsuitable for city living has contributed to the Tibetan mastiff's fall from grace.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The competition was part of a design makeathon where groups were tasked with creating products to solve common everyday problems. The top three finalists are:\n\n1. **Forget Me Lock**: A device that attaches to your key and changes color to indicate whether your door is locked or open. This helps alleviate the stress of forgetting if you've locked your door.\n\n2. **Snooze**: An alarm clock that connects to your phone and silences notifications to ensure a good night's sleep. This addresses the issue of being disturbed by phone notifications while trying to sleep.\n\n3. **Nipper**: A tiny mobile phone charger that uses household batteries as a power source. It's designed for people who run out of battery while out and about.\n\nParticipants can vote for their favorite product on Twitter using the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will go into a Kickstarter campaign to fund its development.

Four out of five children who ate school lunches tried new foods there. Half of the parents surveyed reported that their children requested these new foods to be prepared at home as well. The survey involved about 1,000 parents, and it highlighted that carrots, sweetcorn, and peas were the most popular vegetables among children, while aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. The research was prompted by concerns from parents who believed their children were too fussy to eat school lunches. Rob Rees, the Trust chairman, emphasized the role of school meals in expanding children's diets. Carrie Longton, co-founder of Mumsnet, noted that school meals have improved and that peer pressure can encourage children to eat more healthily at school. The article also mentions that school meals in England must adhere to strict nutritional guidelines and that more primary school children than secondary school children eat school lunches.

The increase in binge drinking doesn't surprise addiction treatment professionals who have seen more people seeking help for alcoholism in recent years. Public health experts attribute the rise in drinking to changing social norms, increased affordability of alcohol due to lower taxes and weaker alcohol control policies, and more aggressive alcohol advertising. The study also noted that the cost of excessive drinking in the US was estimated at more than $220 billion per year, and 88,600 deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Campbell, his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and Carl Halin, 18, were charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. They all pleaded guilty. Campbell was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, Halin received the same sentence, and Ng was sentenced to 23 months. David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, and Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial. Valecce has had the tattoos removed and says the incident has left him with irreparable damage, including fear to go outside and nightmares.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The crackdown on corruption has led to a decline in the gifting of these dogs to officials, and the ban on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities has further reduced their appeal. As a result, many Tibetan mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots and their skin for leather belts. Animal welfare groups have rescued some dogs destined for slaughter, highlighting the cruel fate of these once-prized animals. The situation has also led to an increase in theft of the dogs by gangs and the offloading of 'imperfect' specimens by breeders to abattoirs. The decline in the breed's quality due to profit-driven cross-breeding has exacerbated the problem.
