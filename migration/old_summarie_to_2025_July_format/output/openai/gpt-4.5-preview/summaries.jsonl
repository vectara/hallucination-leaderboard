Public fatigue from past military interventions and political reticence have contributed to this neglect. Despite growing global instability, the UK has significantly reduced its military capabilities, including cuts to army personnel, naval ships, and air force squadrons, creating capability gaps such as the absence of Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Defence spending has fallen from fourth to sixth globally, and the UK is projected to soon drop below NATO's symbolic 2% GDP spending target. Major parties have avoided detailed defence commitments, with only smaller parties explicitly supporting the 2% target. Further defence budget cuts appear likely, given fiscal pressures and lack of political protection for defence spending. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to maintain army size, increase equipment budgets, and renew the Trident nuclear deterrent, while Labour and Liberal Democrats propose more cautious approaches to nuclear deterrence. The upcoming Strategic Defence Review may reconsider nuclear spending, especially given US concerns about the UK's declining conventional capabilities.

This follows the PDP's first-ever presidential election loss last month, with APC leader Muhammadu Buhari set to be inaugurated as president on May 29. The PDP lost key northern states, including Katsina, Kaduna, and Adamawa, but retained control of Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub, and mostly southeastern states. Elections were inconclusive in Imo state, and results from Taraba remain outstanding, while seven states did not hold elections. The APC's gains have reduced the PDP to a regional party, strong mainly in the southeast and Niger Delta. However, the APC failed to win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil production and revenue. Although violence marred elections in some areas, overall the elections were more peaceful than previous ones, suggesting a maturing democracy.

A Canadian study of 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations found that ovary removal after diagnosis reduced breast cancer death by 62% in BRCA1 carriers, but not in BRCA2 carriers. Overall, ovary removal was associated with a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The protective effect was strongest when surgery occurred within two years of diagnosis, showing a 73% reduction in death. Researchers suggest ovary removal should be considered as part of initial treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers, especially those with early-stage breast cancer. BRCA mutations significantly increase lifetime breast cancer risk (50-80%), and are more common among Ashkenazi Jewish women. Jolie, who underwent both a double mastectomy and ovary removal, publicly supported the procedure, emphasizing it did not diminish her sense of femininity.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The passage emphasizes that the real issue is not biology but deeply ingrained gender bias, which continues to limit women's opportunities despite their educational and professional achievements. It cites evidence of overt and covert bias, such as the disproportionate representation of men on corporate boards and biased perceptions of male versus female professors.

A recent survey by vehicle leasing firm OSV found that about a third of men and three-quarters of women have never washed their own cars, with only 12% of men who do wash their cars doing so regularly. Factors contributing to this decline include increased availability of hand car washes, larger vehicles being harder to clean, and busier lifestyles due to Sunday shopping and televised football. Only 5% of respondents have asked their children to wash the car for pocket money. Car washing by owners is most common in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least common in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Owners of Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs are most likely to wash their own cars, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are least likely.

The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, analyzing 130 million galaxy images with significant computational resources. The survey's findings support theories that galaxies form in regions with high concentrations of dark matter.

Children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action compared to wealthier peers committing the same crimes, and poorer youths were five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision. Poverty was identified as a key factor increasing both victimization and perpetration of crime, even after accounting for other risk factors. Gender was also influential, with boys three times more likely than girls to commit violent acts, and poorer girls twice as likely as affluent girls to engage in violence. The research highlighted a destructive cycle where poverty increases violence risk, and contact with juvenile justice systems further exacerbates these risks. Despite overall crime rates in Scotland falling, the most deprived communities continue to experience disproportionately high crime rates, chronic health issues, and unemployment. Researchers emphasized the need to address inequality more effectively, while the Scottish government maintains that Scotland is becoming safer and highlights ongoing initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and inequality.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These earthworks, known as geoglyphs, were hidden beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest until recent deforestation revealed over 450 large geometric structures. Their purpose remains unclear, but due to the lack of artefacts and defensive features, researchers suggest they were likely used sporadically as ritual gathering places. Unlike other ritual sites such as Maya pyramids or Stonehenge, these geoglyphs were constructed within taller vegetation and were probably not visible above the forest canopy. Analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon isotopes indicates that humans significantly influenced the Amazonian environment, selectively cultivating economically valuable trees rather than extensively burning forests. This challenges previous assumptions of pristine pre-European Amazonian ecosystems, suggesting instead a long history of human-managed biodiversity, possibly still influencing the region's forests today.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Public fatigue from past military interventions and political reticence have contributed to this neglect. Despite growing global instability, the UK has significantly reduced its military capabilities, including cuts to army personnel, naval ships, and air force squadrons, creating capability gaps such as the absence of Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Defence spending has fallen from fourth to sixth globally, and the UK is projected to soon drop below NATO's symbolic 2% GDP spending target. Major parties have avoided detailed defence commitments, with only smaller parties explicitly supporting the 2% target. Further defence budget cuts appear likely, given fiscal pressures and lack of political protection for defence spending. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to maintain army size, increase equipment budgets, and renew the Trident nuclear deterrent, while Labour and Liberal Democrats propose more cautious approaches to nuclear deterrence.

Fishing communities strongly supported Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and improve their industry, which they felt suffered under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). However, a House of Lords report highlights potential risks, noting that fishing represents only a small fraction of the UK's GDP and employment, and thus risks being marginalised in Brexit negotiations. The report emphasizes that continued access to EU markets is crucial, as most UK fish exports go to the EU, and warns that this market access may require allowing EU boats continued fishing rights in UK waters. It also stresses the importance of retaining certain CFP elements, such as scientifically-based quotas and international cooperation. Brexit could complicate fisheries management by potentially creating separate regimes for England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these concerns, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic, viewing Brexit as an opportunity for greater control and improved fisheries management.

He and approximately 100,000 other West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) living in Jammu and Kashmir have been denied citizenship rights, including the ability to own property, vote in state elections, or hold state government jobs. This denial stems from pre-independence laws granting citizenship only to those born in the undivided kingdom of Kashmir. Successive state governments have hesitated to grant these rights, fearing demographic shifts in India's only Muslim-majority state. As a result, generations of WPR families remain trapped in poverty, living in slum conditions. However, recent political developments, specifically the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gaining a share of power in Kashmir, have raised hopes among refugees like Ram that their status may finally change. Activists emphasize that granting state-subject rights is essential to improving their conditions, warning that the community is prepared to protest if their demands remain unmet.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Their decline is attributed to China's anti-corruption campaign, which stopped wealthy businessmen from gifting these dogs to officials, and recent bans on owning large dogs in several cities. As a result, many mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skins for leather belts. Animal welfare groups have reported severe cruelty, including dogs being transported without food or water, suffering broken bones, and dying in cramped cages. Additionally, ruthless gangs steal mastiffs from streets, and unscrupulous breeders offload imperfect dogs to slaughterhouses. Overbreeding and cross-breeding for profit have also damaged the breed's quality and temperament. Urbanization has further reduced their popularity, as mastiffs are not suited to city living.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The public can vote via Twitter retweets, and the winning product will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign.
