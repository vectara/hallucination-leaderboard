Public fatigue from past military interventions and political reticence have contributed to this neglect. Despite growing global instability, the UK has significantly reduced its military capabilities, including cuts to army personnel, naval ships, and air force squadrons, creating capability gaps such as the absence of Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Defence spending has fallen from fourth to sixth globally, and the UK is projected to soon drop below NATO's symbolic 2% GDP spending target. Major parties have avoided detailed defence commitments, with only smaller parties explicitly supporting the 2% target. Further defence budget cuts appear likely, given fiscal pressures and lack of political protection for defence spending. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to maintain army size, increase equipment budgets, and renew the Trident nuclear deterrent, while Labour and Liberal Democrats propose more cautious approaches to nuclear deterrence. The upcoming Strategic Defence Review may reconsider nuclear spending, especially given US concerns about the UK's declining conventional capabilities.

This follows the PDP's first-ever presidential election loss last month, with APC leader Muhammadu Buhari set to be inaugurated as president on May 29. The PDP lost key northern states, including Katsina, Kaduna, and Adamawa, but retained control of Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub, and mostly southeastern states. Elections were inconclusive in Imo state, and results from Taraba remain outstanding, while seven states did not hold elections. The APC's gains have reduced the PDP to a regional party, strong mainly in the southeast and Niger Delta. However, the APC failed to win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil production and revenue. Although violence marred elections in some areas, overall the elections were more peaceful than previous ones, suggesting a maturing democracy. The PDP's defeat was attributed to voter desire for change, corruption allegations, defections to the APC, and perceived failures in addressing the Boko Haram insurgency.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This follows the PDP's first-ever presidential election loss last month, with APC leader Muhammadu Buhari set to be inaugurated as president on May 29. The PDP lost key northern states, including Katsina, Kaduna, and Adamawa, but retained control of Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub, and mostly southeastern states. Elections in Taraba remain outstanding, while Imo state's election was inconclusive. The APC's gains have reduced the PDP to a regional party, strong mainly in the southeast and Niger Delta. However, the APC failed to win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil production and revenue. Although violence marred elections in some areas, overall the elections were more peaceful than previous ones, suggesting a maturing democracy. The PDP's defeat was attributed to voter desire for change, corruption allegations, defections to the APC, and perceived failures in addressing the Islamist insurgency in the northeast.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

However, critics, including Labour and the National Housing Federation, argue that this approach would drive lower-income families out of affluent areas, creating segregated communities. Labour suggests alternative funding methods, such as a bank bonus tax, to build affordable homes.

Public fatigue from past military interventions and political reticence have contributed to this neglect. Despite growing global instability, the UK has significantly reduced its military capabilities, including cuts to army personnel, naval ships, and air force squadrons, creating capability gaps such as the absence of Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Defence spending has fallen from fourth to sixth globally, and the UK is projected to soon drop below NATO's symbolic 2% GDP spending target. Major parties have avoided detailed defence commitments, with only smaller parties explicitly supporting the 2% target. Further defence budget cuts appear likely, given fiscal pressures and lack of political protection for defence spending. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to maintain army size, increase equipment budgets, and renew the Trident nuclear deterrent, while Labour and Liberal Democrats propose more cautious approaches to nuclear deterrence. The upcoming Strategic Defence Review may reconsider nuclear spending, especially given US concerns about the UK's declining conventional capabilities.

Another coup in 2000 involved the hostage-taking of Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister and his cabinet.

Indo-Fijian numbers have declined due to emigration following political unrest, leaving indigenous Fijians as a slight majority.

A Canadian study of 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations found that ovary removal after diagnosis reduced breast cancer death by 62% in BRCA1 carriers, but not in BRCA2 carriers. Overall, ovary removal was associated with a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The protective effect was strongest when surgery occurred within two years of diagnosis, showing a 73% reduction in death. Researchers suggest ovary removal should be considered as part of initial treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers, especially those with early-stage breast cancer. BRCA mutations significantly increase lifetime breast cancer risk (50-80%), and are more common among Ashkenazi Jewish women.
