Manager Louis van Gaal, who coached Depay during Holland’s 2014 World Cup run, is eager to make him one of his first summer signings. Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season, helped PSV win their first Eredivisie title in seven years. Tottenham previously failed with a £15 million bid, and other top clubs like PSG are also interested. Depay began his career at amateur side VV Moordrecht and joined PSV at age 12. Known for his speed, dribbling, and powerful shooting, he is seen as a future star, with some comparing his potential to Arjen Robben and a young Cristiano Ronaldo.
