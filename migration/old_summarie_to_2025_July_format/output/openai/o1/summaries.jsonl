Schools report a positive impact on motivation, with tablet use also encouraging parental involvement when devices go home. Usage is particularly high in academy schools, and overall numbers of tablets in schools are predicted to rise steeply. A separate study suggests tablets are especially helpful for boys and poorer pupils when learning to read. Many students use devices late at night for social media or videos; some even consider themselves “addicts.” Despite the difficulty of directly linking tablets to academic improvement, school leaders see value in reflecting real-world technology use and fostering a sense of empowerment among students.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
