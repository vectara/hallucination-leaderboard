By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with boys showing the greatest weight—and slight height—increases. The researchers suggest antibiotics may promote weight gain by disrupting gut bacteria that normally consume calories and help regulate appetite. While causation isn’t proven, lead author Dr. Antti Saari warned that early and frequent antibiotic use “was associated with increased body mass in healthy children” and could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous studies have also linked infant antibiotic exposure to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems, and growing over‑prescription raises concerns about antibiotic resistance.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o4-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Stiviano maintained the gifts were legitimate and that she did not exploit Sterling. Shelly Sterling’s lawyer hailed the ruling as a victory for recovering “ill‑begotten gifts” and setting a precedent for injured spouses. Donald Sterling fell from grace when an audio recording captured him making racist remarks about Stiviano posting photos with African‑Americans, including Magic Johnson.

Operating across seven boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the UK’s largest housing benefit claimants. For example, on one two-tenant property it claimed £2,114/month while paying the landlord £1,150, netting an annual gross profit of £11,568.\n\nTenants like Nigel McCann report uninhabitable conditions—rats, damp, no heating or hot water—and criticize the focus on profit over welfare. Nearly half of Investing Solutions’ two‑year, £4.2 million benefit haul came from Wandsworth Council, which says it monitors private-sector housing. Crisis charity calls the partnership “a new low.” Patel insists Fresh Start is independently governed, most rent is passed to landlords, and he is “concerned” about the property-condition claims. Fresh Start says it has housed 788 people since 2010 (222 in the past year) but won’t disclose how many went through Investing Solutions. The Department for Communities and Local Government emphasizes that local authorities must rigorously safeguard public funds in private‑sector housing.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o4-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once home to the first British daily (the Daily Courant, 1702) and nicknamed both “the Street of Shame” and “the pinnacle of a journalist’s career,” Fleet Street teemed with typewriters, printing presses, bars and pubs where reporters socialized and chased stories. Smith recalls sharing an address with Sweeney Todd’s fictional barber shop and sneaking into the men‑only El Vino; Sherriff remembers smoke‑filled newsrooms, paper‑laden lorries and a landscape now overrun by sandwich shops. The decline began in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved key titles to Wapping, triggering a bitter print‑union dispute, and accelerated as papers adopted cheaper, computerized production and dispersed across London. Buildings once occupied by national titles now house supermarkets and restaurant chains. Ex‑editor Robin Esser emphasizes how crucial Fleet Street once was—providing 85% of public information—while Liz Hodgkinson’s reminiscences highlight the rowdy, male‑dominated culture of the 1970s and ’80s.

With Luis Suárez sold and Daniel Sturridge often injured, Rodgers has failed to replace their combined 52 goals, recruiting Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini—none of whom match the finishing, work‑rate, pressing intensity or set‑piece threat of last season’s front two. Defensively, big‑money signings Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren have yet to shore up a back line that remains as leaky as before, while goalkeeper Simon Mignolet offers shot‑stopping but little command of his area.\n\nLooking ahead to Chelsea, Savage names a side of Mignolet; Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno; Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana; Borini, dropping Lovren despite his fee. He stresses the need for balanced full‑back runs and a solid midfield four but still sees Chelsea as overwhelming favourites and predicts another painful Anfield defeat.\n\nOn Steven Gerrard, Savage believes the midfielder—haunted by his slip that cost the title six months ago—is far from finished. At 34, Gerrard’s challenge is both physical (maintaining mobility and recovery) and mental (overcoming doubts about his legs), yet his leadership, fitness and desire mean he remains pivotal to Liverpool’s short‑ and long‑term plans.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o4-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once home to the first British daily (the Daily Courant, 1702) and nicknamed both “the Street of Shame” and “the pinnacle of a journalist’s career,” Fleet Street teemed with typewriters, printing presses, bars and pubs where reporters socialized and chased stories. Smith recalls sharing an address with Sweeney Todd’s fictional barber shop and sneaking into the men‑only El Vino; Sherriff remembers smoke‑filled newsrooms, paper‑laden lorries and a landscape now overrun by sandwich shops. The decline began in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved key titles to Wapping, triggering a bitter print‑union dispute, and accelerated as papers adopted cheaper, computerized production and dispersed across London. Buildings once occupied by national titles now house supermarkets and restaurant chains. Ex‑editor Robin Esser emphasizes how crucial Fleet Street once was—providing 85% of public information—while Liz Hodgkinson’s reminiscences highlight the rowdy, male‑dominated culture of the 1970s and ’80s.
