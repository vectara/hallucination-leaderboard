This decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has discouraged wealthy individuals from gifting these dogs to officials. Additionally, recent bans on owning large dogs in several cities have further impacted their popularity. Animal welfare workers have rescued mastiffs being transported to slaughterhouses, where many were found in poor conditions. The breed's quality has also deteriorated due to profit-driven cross-breeding. Urbanization has made it clear that Tibetan mastiffs are not suitable for city living, contributing to their decline from status symbols to unwanted animals.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "GPT-4o-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It highlights that poverty increases the likelihood of violence among youth and that a history of police trouble is a strong predictor of being out of education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young people are also significantly more likely to be placed under statutory supervision. The study indicates that extreme poverty correlates with higher rates of both victimization and perpetration of crime, and gender plays a role, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violence.

The research revealed over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" hidden under rainforest until recent deforestation. The purpose of these sites remains unclear, but they are thought to have been used sporadically for rituals rather than as villages or defensive structures. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples indicates that the geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, making them likely invisible above the forest canopy. The study challenges the notion of pre-Columbian Amazon as untouched by humans, suggesting that ancient peoples cultivated a diverse range of plant species, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of valuable forest products.

It highlights that poverty increases the likelihood of violence among youth and that a history of police trouble is a strong predictor of being out of education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young people are also significantly more likely to be placed under statutory supervision. The study indicates that extreme poverty correlates with higher rates of both victimization and perpetration of crime, and gender plays a role, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violence. The findings suggest that despite a general decline in crime rates in Scotland, the most deprived communities continue to experience high crime levels, raising concerns about the effectiveness of government efforts to address inequality. The Scottish government claims crime is at a historic low and emphasizes its commitment to tackling poverty and supporting vulnerable populations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "GPT-4o-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Jolie had a double mastectomy and an oophorectomy, which contributed to her decision-making regarding her health. The research analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations, revealing that those who had oophorectomies experienced a 62% reduction in breast cancer deaths and a 65% reduction in deaths from all causes. The protective effects of oophorectomy were evident immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years, particularly benefiting those with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. The study emphasizes the need for further research, especially for BRCA2 carriers, and suggests that oophorectomy should be part of treatment discussions for early-stage breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "GPT-4o-mini", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
