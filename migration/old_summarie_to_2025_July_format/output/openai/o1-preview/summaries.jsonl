Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly affected. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two further increased the likelihood of being overweight, especially among boys, who were also found to be slightly taller than their peers who had not received antibiotics.\n\nThe study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria that normally aid in metabolism, potentially leading to increased appetite and weight gain. Although causation was not established, lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that such exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, which is more pronounced in boys. The findings align with concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics contributing to unintended health consequences, including obesity, eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, there is growing worry that antibiotic overuse may lead to the emergence of superbugs, with the government warning of a new strain that could infect up to 200,000 Britons and cause 80,000 deaths in a single outbreak.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Compared to voice communication, Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions and remains comprehensible without a decoding device.

Despite opposition from hardliners led by Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in power since 1971 and opposes the dialogue process, Sheikh Salman insists that now is the time for dialogue and negotiations.\n\nHe acknowledged that many young protesters have lost faith in the main opposition parties, feeling that seeking permission to demonstrate or calling for a constitutional monarchy under the current ruling family is ineffective, especially as they accuse the family of ongoing violence. Sheikh Salman recalled that hours before Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) troops were deployed to suppress dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and the opposition had agreed on a seven-point plan to move Bahrain toward a constitutional monarchy. The arrival of GCC troops, however, severed this dialogue.\n\nRegarding international involvement, Sheikh Salman expressed hope that newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would \"do more than his predecessor\" by exerting clearer and more direct pressure on Bahrain for human rights and democratic practices. He criticized the UK government's approach, urging Prime Minister David Cameron to speak out publicly against violence and human rights abuses rather than relying on private communications, which he says have been ineffective.\n\nDespite a ban on public gatherings in Bahrain, Sheikh Salman reiterated al-Wefaq's commitment to calling for \"peaceful demonstrations\" as the only way to pressure the government.

His funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date.\n\nHogwood worked with many leading orchestras worldwide and was considered one of the most influential exponents of historically informed performance. He founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed it for approximately 30 years, bringing the ensemble to six continents. Under his leadership, the AAM made over 200 CDs, including the first complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. One of his most famous recordings is the 1980 version of Handel's *Messiah* with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by **BBC Music Magazine** as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.\n\nEducated at Cambridge University, Hogwood studied keyboard with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts, and later with Zuzana RÅ¯Å¾iÄkovÃ¡ and Gustav Leonhardt. Early in his career, he served as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner and was a founding member of the Early Music Consort of London.\n\nHogwood held several prominent positions, including artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also an educator, serving as a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge, and professor-at-large at Cornell University in the United States.\n\nColleagues and admirers paid tribute to Hogwood's legacy. Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, praised his \"extraordinary generosity of spirit\" and called him \"a great ambassador for historically informed music.\" Richard Egarr, the AAM's music director, expressed deep sadness at his passing and acknowledged the \"fantastic legacy\" Hogwood provided. Soprano Dame Emma Kirkby highlighted his academic brilliance and his role in mentoring musicians who now lead orchestras worldwide.

Despite having world champions like Fernando Alonso, arguably one of the best drivers on the grid, McLaren has struggled to regain its former glory. Dennis remains confident that success is imminent and believes McLaren will be the next team to break Mercedes' dominance in the sport.\n\nThe team's current predicament raises questions about whether they are in a state of terminal decline or poised for a comeback. McLaren's leadership asserts that with continued development and improvements to both the car and the Honda power unit, they will once again achieve championship success. The future of the team, as well as the legacy of its star drivers, hinges on their ability to translate this belief into on-track results.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

For Christmas, they're presenting Star Wars-themed sermons titled \"The Hope Awakens,\" drawing parallels between the franchise and the message of hope in Christianity.\n\n2. **Guardians of Ancora**: A free fantasy game developed by the Scripture Union for children aged 8 to 11, available on Android, iPhone, and Kindle. Players become guardians in a world where light has been stolen, embarking on quests to rediscover lost Bible stories, including special Christmas content about the birth of Jesus, to bring light back to the world.\n\n3. **Modern Nativity Videos**: Creative retellings of the nativity story are gaining traction online. Notably, Viral.de's 2010 video \"The Digital Story of Nativity\" narrates the birth of Jesus through modern social media updates and has amassed nearly six million views. Similarly, the Churches Advertising Network produced \"Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle,\" showing a couple transitioning through eras to become Mary and Joseph, emphasizing that the essence of Christmas remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Manga Messiah by Next Manga**: After significant success with printed manga-style Bible stories, Next Manga released digital versions of their works, including \"Manga Messiah,\" which portrays the nativity story. Available in 33 languages, they've distributed thousands of copies globally, including 25,000 in Arabic to Syrian and Libyan refugees, aiming to share a message of hope and peace.\n\n5. **Social Media Engagement**: Churches and Christian organizations are increasingly using platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with communities during the festive season. By sharing inspirational thoughts and encouraging people to reflect on spiritual matters, they adapt to contemporary communication methods. Some leaders suggest that if Jesus were here today, he'd utilize social media to spread his message due to his role as a great communicator.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate how technology and digital platforms can enrich the spiritual experience of Christmas, making it accessible and engaging for a modern audience while preserving its traditional messages.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and about five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision compared to their more affluent peers committing the same offenses. Poverty also exacerbates the risk of violence among both boys and girls. While boys are generally three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, girls from poorer households are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime as those from wealthier backgrounds, even when accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision.\n\nThe research indicates that a history of trouble with the police is the strongest predictor of a young person being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18. It suggests that involvement with the juvenile justice system may inadvertently reinforce the conditions that perpetuate violence. Another study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) reveals that despite overall crime rates in Scotland reaching a 41-year low, the most deprived communities have not benefited from this decline. Crime remains highly concentrated among poor individuals and neighborhoods, which also suffer from high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about whether the Scottish government is effectively addressing inequality.

Local traders like Matt O'Brien, who runs a family-owned men's clothing shop, have faced significant challenges, with business declining by 30% during the recession and staff layoffs. However, signs of recovery are emerging as businesses adapt by diversifying their offerings; O'Brien's shop has expanded into childrenswear and dress-hire services to boost sales.\n\nFianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, criticizes the Fine Gael-Labour coalition government for its handling of economic development in the midlands. Local TD Robert Troy argues that the â¬500 million investment in water metersâset to become operational in several yearsâwould be better spent on improving broadband infrastructure. He also highlights the lack of attention from the Industrial Development Authority (IDA), noting that no potential foreign investors have been brought to Longford in over four years.\n\nIn response, the government points to the proposed Center Parcs holiday resort in Ballymahon, County Longford, which is expected to create about 1,000 jobs upon its planned opening in 2019, pending planning permission. Local Fine Gael TD James Bannon is optimistic about the project's success, emphasizing the region's attractive scenery and recreational opportunities, such as the Shannon and Inny rivers and the Royal Canal.\n\nDespite these developments, local traders believe more can be done to stimulate the economy. Concerns include issues like paid street parking, which neighboring towns do not have, potentially deterring shoppers. The overarching sentiment in the midlands is that while economic recovery is beginning to take hold, additional measures are needed to support local businesses and fully revitalize the area.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The function of these geoglyphs remains uncertain; they are unlikely to be villages or defensive sites due to few artefacts found and their non-defensive layouts. Instead, they may have served as ritual gathering places, similar to Central America's Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. However, unlike those monuments, these geoglyphs were constructed among tall vegetation and were likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n\nDr. Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs, studying phytoliths to reconstruct ancient vegetation, charcoal quantities to assess forest burning, and carbon stable isotopes to determine past vegetation types. The research suggests that ancient peoples transformed their environment not by large-scale burning but by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms, indicating early agroforestry practices. This challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems untouched by humans before European arrival in the 16th century. The team likens this to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests today may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

By comparing full-time males with full-time females and part-time males with part-time females, the researchers eliminated the impact of part-time status on earnings. The study found no evidence supporting the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggests that women avoid requesting higher pay due to reluctance or fear of upsetting their employer. When comparing similar male and female workers, men were 25% more likely to receive a pay increase when they asked. The researchers accounted for factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications.\n\nThe data was sourced from the 2013-14 Australian Workplace Relations Survey, noted for systematically recording whether employees had asked for a pay rise and their reasons.

Despite increasing global instabilityâevidenced by mass migrations from failed states, the threat of Islamic extremism, and a more assertive Russiaâthe UK is reducing its military capabilities. The regular Army is shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy operates just 19 warships, and the Royal Air Force is down to eight, soon to be seven, front-line fast jet squadrons. Additionally, the UK has gaps in capabilities, such as lacking Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relying on NATO allies to monitor Russian submarines near its waters.\n\nDefence spending is declining, with the UK falling from the fourth to the sixth largest global defence spender, now trailing behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France. A significant point of contention is the commitment to NATO's guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defenceâa target only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledge to meet. Projections indicate UK defence spending may drop to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, or even 1.5% with further cuts.\n\nFuture governments are expected to implement additional defence budget reductions as they strive to decrease the national deficit. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), holding one of the largest unprotected budgets at Â£34 billion annually, faces potential cuts of Â£2-3 billion per year. While the Conservatives have committed to replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent, increasing the equipment budget by 1% annually, and maintaining army personnel levels, these promises constrain their ability to find savings without impacting their fiscal plans. Labour has avoided making similar commitments, and military leaders anticipate inevitable cuts.\n\nThe renewal of the Trident nuclear programme is a divisive issue. The Conservatives and UKIP support a full like-for-like replacement at an estimated cost of at least Â£20 billion, accounting for a quarter of the MoD's equipment budget over the next decade. Labour proposes maintaining continuous at-sea deterrence with potentially three submarines instead of four, the Liberal Democrats suggest a reduced \"part-time deterrent,\" and the SNP and Greens advocate for scrapping it entirely. This lack of consensus raises the possibility of further delays or revisions to the programme.\n\nThe UK is set to introduce two new aircraft carriersâthe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Walesâby the end of the decade. However, there are concerns about insufficient crew and aircraft to fully utilize these vessels. Plans to equip them with F-35 jets have been scaled back, with only 12 aircraft expected to be deployed despite the carriers' capacity for 36. Military leaders warn of a \"hollow force\" possessing advanced equipment but lacking adequate personnel.\n\nThese developments challenge the long-held notion that Britain can \"punch above its weight\" militarily on the global stage. Ongoing budget constraints and reductions in military capability raise concerns about the UK's future defence posture and its ability to respond to international threats effectively.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Savage observes that Liverpool are currently far from the level required to contend for the Premier League title and may struggle to secure a top-four finish. This downturn is partly due to the team overachieving last season, which has led to unrealistic expectations among fans.\n\nSavage critiques manager Brendan Rodgers' transfer decisions, particularly in replacing strikers Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. The current forward optionsâMario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, and Fabio Boriniâare deemed insufficient, lacking both goal-scoring prowess and the high work-rate that characterized Liverpool's attack last season. This deficiency has resulted in a significant drop in early goals and a lack of pressing intensity, leaving the team often chasing games.\n\nDefensive frailties persist despite substantial investments in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The back line lacks leadership, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's hesitance to command his area exacerbates the issue. Set-piece effectiveness has also declined sharply, removing a crucial source of goals from the previous campaign.\n\nAhead of the clash with Chelsea, Savage proposes a lineup that includes Kolo Toure over Lovren, citing Toure's solid performance against Real Madrid. He emphasizes the need for disciplined full-backs and a dynamic midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling to challenge Chelsea's robust defense. However, Savage concedes that even with these adjustments, it's difficult to envision Liverpool defeating a Chelsea side that appears superior in all facets of the game.\n\nAddressing Steven Gerrard's situation, Savage acknowledges the psychological and physical hurdles the 34-year-old faces. Despite the infamous slip against Chelsea that marred last season and ongoing speculation about his future, Gerrard remains one of Liverpool's key players. Savage believes Gerrard's experience, skill set, and enduring fitness make him integral to the team's long-term plans. He commends Gerrard's resilience and continued contributions, underscoring his status as one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders.\n\nOverall, Savage's analysis underscores the significant challenges Liverpool face in replicating past successes and the critical decisions required to restore their competitiveness at the highest level.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A coup by indigenous Fijians in 1987 overthrew an elected, Indian-dominated coalition government, triggering adverse events such as the introductionâand subsequent withdrawalâof a constitution promoting indigenous Fijian political supremacy. In 2000, a coup led by businessman George Speight resulted in the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet, and several MPs being held hostage for several weeks. These events severely harmed Fiji's economy, particularly the tourism industry, and tarnished its international reputation.\n\nPersistent disputes over granting amnesty to those behind the 2000 coup fueled ongoing tensions, culminating in a bloodless military takeover in 2006âthe fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth due to a lack of progress toward democracy, marking only the second full suspension in the organization's history. The government agreed in 2012 to hold free elections in 2014, leading to the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Australia and New Zealand and Fiji's reinstatement in the Commonwealth after the elections.\n\nFiji's population is primarily based on the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, and is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijiansâthe descendants of indentured laborers from India.

The volatility index, a measure of investor uncertainty, reached levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nInvestors are concerned due to data suggesting a decreased likelihood of a Remain vote. Two recent polls showed the Leave campaign ahead, and betting firm Betfair reported the implied probability of a Remain outcome dropping to 68.5% from nearly 80% the previous week. Analysts like Charalambos Pissouros anticipate that incoming polls will cause more pronounced movements in the pound's value as the referendum approaches.\n\nHedge funds have been betting on further declines in sterling, with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed noting increased short-selling activities. Joe Rundle of ETX Capital stated that markets are on full Brexit alert, observing that sterling has shed more than 2% over two sessions.\n\nGlobal markets have also been affected. Asian stock markets saw significant drops due to concerns about the economic impact of a potential Brexit, with Japan's Nikkei index closing down 3.5% and Hong Kong's main index falling by 2.5%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.1%, with financial institutions like Lloyds Banking Group experiencing notable declines.\n\nNigel Farage, a Leave campaigner, argued that despite recent volatility, sterling is stronger since March and that the FTSE 100 remains at similar levels. He also highlighted that a weaker pound could benefit UK exporters. Supporting this point, recent official figures indicated that the UK's trade deficit narrowed in April due to a surge in exports.\n\nIn summary, the passage highlights the heightened market volatility and investor anxiety caused by the approaching Brexit referendum, reflected in currency fluctuations, stock market declines, and shifting polling data influencing market expectations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

War,\"** which was initially begun by the assassinated opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and completed by his colleagues, led by Ilya Yashin. The report compiles existing information from Russian and foreign media about Russia's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea in March 2014.\n\nDespite Russia's consistent denial of deploying regular troops and armor to support pro-Russian rebelsâclaiming any Russians fighting there are volunteersâthe report presents evidence suggesting otherwise. It includes admissions from Russian soldiers and veterans that Russian military units and generals played decisive roles in key victories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Some volunteers reportedly received salaries ranging from $2,000 to $3,000 per month. The estimated Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53 billion rubles (approximately $1 billion).\n\nThe report faces challenges in publication and distribution due to fear among publishers and a limited initial print run of 2,000 copies. The opposition accuses President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating and directing the war in Ukraine to bolster his declining popularityâa strategy they concede has been successful. However, there is skepticism about the report's impact, as previous works by Nemtsov exposing corruption and the true costs of the 2014 Sochi Olympics did not galvanize public protests against Putin. Many Russians are either unaware of or indifferent to the details, with some accepting the government's actions as support for those seeking independence from Kiev.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, glaciers descending from Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains covered approximately 375 square kilometers. By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to about 275 square kilometers, marking an average loss of 26%. The research, conducted by Marie Gardent and colleagues from the University of Savoie, assessed around 600 glaciers across several massifs, including Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nUsing historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, the team verified glacier boundaries through manual inspection to account for issues like debris cover and shadowing that can affect automatic delineation methods. The retreat is not uniform across the region; southern sectors like the Belledonne Massif have seen glaciers nearly disappear, and the Ecrins Massif has experienced retreat over three times greater than that of the Mont Blanc Massif. Factors contributing to the greater losses in the south include lower elevations and different climatic conditions, such as less precipitation and cloud cover compared to the northern Alps.\n\nThe northern Alps, which receive more precipitation, have experienced less significant glacier retreat. For instance, France's largest glacier, La Mer de Glace on Mont Blanc, has seen a slight area reduction from 31.5 square kilometers in the late 1960s to just over 30 square kilometers in the late 2000s. This study mirrors findings in other parts of the Alps, including Switzerland, where accelerated glacier mass loss has also been reported. The ongoing efforts to monitor glacier health underscore the broader impacts of climate variations across the Alpine region.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Fishing regions voted heavily for Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation akin to Norway. However, the industry contributes only 0.5% to the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority for the government.\n\nThe report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared with EU states, and the majority of UK-caught fish are exported to the EU, while much of the fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU countries. Continued access to the EU market is crucial for the industry's success but may come at the cost of allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\nThe Committee suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing quotas on scientific advice and cooperating with neighboring countries. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives are optimistic. They point to recent increases in allowable catches under the CFP as a positive sign and believe that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch shares and improved sustainable fisheries management. The government asserts its commitment to ensuring the fishing industry has maximum freedom to trade within the single market while reviewing fisheries management to maintain fair quotas and healthy marine environments.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, calls for a radical expansion of higher-level apprenticeshipsâup to 300,000 new starts annually, primarily at level three and above, lasting at least three years. He emphasizes that quality apprenticeships are crucial for social mobility and that the current system hinders economic competitiveness and access to skilled jobs for young people.\n\nThe Department for Education responds that it is reforming apprenticeships to improve standards, including making them more rigorous and ensuring they last a minimum of a year with increased focus on English and maths. The Association of Colleges agrees on prioritizing level three apprenticeships but argues that respected level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, should be preserved. They acknowledge the challenge in creating more apprenticeship opportunities due to the current shortage of places for 16-year-olds and emphasize the need for high-quality facilities, expert teaching, and improved career guidance.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In a historic milestone, three women became the first female submariners in the Royal Navy last May. \n\nSimilarly, nearly 100 female British soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan between January 2006 and December 2013 after discovering they were pregnant, with 16 in 2013 and 18 in 2011. An additional 102 women were evacuated from Iraq. Strict military rules prohibit pregnant women from serving in war zones. While troops are reminded by senior officers to ensure they are not pregnant before deployment, they are not required to undergo pregnancy tests. Most pregnancies were likely conceived before leaving the UK, though some may have occurred during deployment. According to a Ministry of Defence spokesman, \"The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity.\"", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines heavy drinking as consuming more than one drink per day for women and more than two for men over the past month; binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase is largely driven by changing social norms affecting women's drinking habits. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women rose more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates increased nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared to a 23% increase among men.\n\nIn 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers, while the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained relatively unchanged. The study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, highlighted regional variations: Madison County, Idaho, had the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, whereas Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest at 36%; Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers at 2%, and Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most at 22%.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in excessive drinking, including increased alcohol advertising expenditures (about $3.45 billion in 2011), alcohol becoming cheaper due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, weakened alcohol control policies, and the influence of affluent professionals in urban areas who may engage in hard-partying lifestyles. Young people and wealthier individuals are more likely to binge drink, and changing social norms have made it more acceptable for women to drink heavily.\n\nAlcohol-related issues have significant societal costs, with approximately 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of excessive drinking exceeding $220 billion. While more individuals are seeking treatment for alcoholism, many do not seek help unless faced with serious consequences like job loss or legal issues.\n\nThe findings are based on data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older, collected through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

They stress that caesareans should only be conducted when medically necessary due to the risks of infections, significant complications, disabilities, and even death associated with the procedure. In England, over 25% of women now give birth via caesarean, a rate that has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This rise includes an increasing number of women opting for planned caesareans due to severe anxiety about natural childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia.\n\nThe WHO advocates for an optimal caesarean rate between 10% and 15%, considering the health dangers and financial costs involved. Their stance contrasts sharply with current NHS guidelines, which allow women to choose caesareans even without medical justification. The procedure's higher costâaveraging Â£2,369 for a planned caesarean compared to Â£1,665 for a natural birthâalso diverts funds from other healthcare needs. Additionally, prior research indicates that up to one in ten caesareans result in infections.\n\nThe WHO urges doctors to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections and to be more cognizant of the associated risks and costs, emphasizing that overuse of the procedure can have adverse short- and long-term health effects on women and their babies.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This increase is linked primarily to intravenous drug users sharing needles while using the prescription painkiller Opana. In response, Governor Mike Pence approved a temporary 30-day needle exchange program on March 26. \n\nSince the program's initiation, over 5,322 clean syringes have been distributed to 86 participants, and approximately 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Health officials, including Brittany Combs of the Scott County Health Department, note that participation has increased, partly due to mobile units reaching out to at-risk individuals. Officials expect the number of HIV cases to continue rising as more people undergo testing.\n\nThe future of the needle exchange program is uncertain. Governor Pence, who generally opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing whether to extend the program beyond its April 25 end date. Concurrently, legislation proposed by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere aims to allow 23 Indiana counties with high hepatitis C ratesâa key indicator of potential HIV outbreaksâto establish their own needle exchange programs. However, some lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long, express concerns that such programs might promote drug use.\n\nFunding remains a challenge, as federal funds cannot be used for needle exchange programs due to a ban in place since 1989. Governor Pence's executive order did not allocate state funds for the program, leaving agencies to source their own funding. Health experts like Dr. Beth Meyerson from Indiana University question the sustainability of this approach and emphasize the need for long-term solutions to address the epidemic.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This technology creates local networks where each phone acts as a node, enabling messages and photos to be sent securely and anonymously to nearby users within approximately 30 feet (9 meters).\n\nThe \"Everyone\" setting in FireChat extends this capability by connecting all nodes into one network, allowing messages to relay from one node to another, reaching recipients up to about 200 feet (61 meters) away. GreenStone serves as a beacon or booster within these networks, filling gaps to extend the range and reliability of message transmission. With a range of around 20 feet (6 meters), GreenStone holds messages until another FireChat user comes within range, features a one-year battery life, and can store up to 1,000 recent messages.\n\nThis technology is particularly useful in situations where traditional networks are unavailable or overloaded, such as on planes, in underground transport, at music festivals, protests, or sporting events. Open Garden is collaborating with manufacturers to design and distribute GreenStone devices, aiming to provide resilient communication options in various environments without relying on conventional connectivity.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In a TED Talk, she explained that just as she calls herself \"short\" because she is 5'3\" and \"wife\" because she is married, \"fat\" is simply another factual characteristic that doesn't equate to being \"ugly.\" Bustle highlighted the rise in size discriminationâup 66% in the past 30 yearsâand noted that negative perceptions of larger bodies begin at a young age, with many girls wishing to be thinner.\n\nShe emphasized that increased exposure to diverse body types leads to greater acceptance and appreciation. By performing burlesque, Bustle aims to present her \"fat\" body in a positive, glamorous way, challenging societal beauty standards. Inspired by other performers who promote body diversity, she began performing in 2012 and found the experience empowering and transformative for her self-esteem. She encourages others to find their own \"courage reference\"âa personal moment of bravery to draw strength from during times of insecurity.\n\nAfter her TED Talk was posted on YouTube, Bustle received an overwhelmingly positive response, including messages from individuals re-evaluating their views on their bodies. Despite encountering some negative comments, she remains optimistic about the progress of the body-positivity movement, believing that increased exposure and open dialogue are helping to shift perceptions in a more inclusive direction.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers from the University of Manchester, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, spent two years measuring the shapes of galaxies to construct the map, which was released at the American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570-megapixel imaging device used in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) based at the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.\n\nCovering about 0.4% of the sky, the map displays clumps of dark matter by detecting the distortion of light from distant galaxiesâa phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Since dark matter does not emit or block light, its presence is inferred from these gravitational effects. The DES aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe findings support theories that galaxies form in areas with large concentrations of dark matter due to stronger gravitational forces. The maps reveal large filaments of matter where galaxies and clusters reside, as well as cosmic voids with few galaxies. Analyzing the clumpiness of dark matter will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to cause the accelerated expansion of the universe. The project involves analyzing 130 million images of galaxies, a task that requires substantial computational resources, including some of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Aaron Nemane showcased skill on the wing, outwitting opponents but struggling to deliver the final decisive pass.

While he would attend the same-sex wedding of a family member or staffer out of love and respect, he maintains that marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman. Rubio argues that states should regulate marriage and that decisions about same-sex marriage should be made by state legislatures through political debate, not by courts. He does not believe same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. Despite his personal beliefs, Rubio emphasizes the importance of respecting and loving individuals, even if he disagrees with their choices, drawing parallels with his views on divorce within his Catholic faith. Recently, Rubio announced his presidential candidacy and has reportedly received significant financial commitments exceeding $47 million to support his campaign.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Their main expense is food, costing about 2.74 euros per day, which they manage by eating simple staples, accepting food donations, foraging wild fruits, and occasionally dumpster diving in western countries.\n\nTheir route has taken them from the UK through France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia.

{"article_id": 840, "summary_uid": "56b364e4dd7cfba1189a02fa7108a272", "summary": "Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, suggests that increased smartphone use and constant technological connectivity are contributing to a decline in the frequency of sexual activity among couples in Britain. Research presented in his book *Sex by Numbers* indicates that the average British heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this trend to the erosion of boundaries between work and personal life, as people are frequently checking emails and remaining connected to work during home hours. Catherine Mercer from the British National Survey supports this view, stating that with more competing demands on time and the pervasive use of technology, sex often falls lower on people's list of priorities, and individuals may find it difficult to focus on their partners at bedtime due to ongoing connections with the outside world.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These dogs are now so unwanted that they're being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skin made into leather belts. Several factors contribute to this downturn:\n\n- **Anti-Corruption Crackdown**: The Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign has deterred wealthy businessmen from gifting Tibetan Mastiffs to officials as a means of influence. Luo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, noted that people no longer dare to give or accept these dogs as gifts.\n\n- **Urban Restrictions**: Recent bans on owning dogs weighing more than 50 kg in several Chinese citiesâincluding Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjinâhave significantly impacted the breed's popularity.\n\n- **Breeding Issues**: Unscrupulous breeders engaged in cross-breeding practices have led to a deterioration in the dogs' appearance and temperament. This has resulted in a surplus of poor-quality dogs that are difficult to sell.\n\n- **Urbanization**: The rapid pace of urbanization has made more people realize that Tibetan Mastiffs are not well-suited to city living.\n\nAnimal welfare workers have rescued Tibetan Mastiffs en route to slaughterhouses supplying meat for hotpot restaurants. Many of these dogs were found in cramped cages without food or water, with some already dead or suffering from broken bones. Additionally, there are reports of gangs stealing Mastiffs from the streets to sell to slaughterhouses, and breeders offloading \"imperfect\" dogs to abattoirs.\n\nThe breed's fall from grace is stark compared to its heyday starting in 2005 when Tibetan Mastiffs became status symbols. In 2014, a golden-haired one-year-old Mastiff puppy sold for Â£1.2 millionâthe highest price ever paid for a dog at the time. However, due to the factors above, the breed's fortune has dramatically reversed.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

{"article_id": 3, "summary_uid": "9283ac67c09ae3ffc693d44b1c0ee7f1", "summary": "A Finnish study published in the journal *Pediatrics* found that babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be overweight or obese as toddlers. Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly affected. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two further increased the likelihood of being overweight, especially among boys, who were also found to be slightly taller than their peers who had not received antibiotics.\n\nThe study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria that normally aid in metabolism, potentially leading to increased appetite and weight gain. Although causation was not established, lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that such exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, which is more pronounced in boys. The findings align with concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics contributing to unintended health consequences, including obesity, eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, there is growing worry that antibiotic overuse may lead to the emergence of superbugs, with the government warning of a new strain that could infect up to 200,000 Britons and cause 80,000 deaths in a single outbreak.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Both fighters seem to prefer the lighter gloves, with McGregor, accustomed to 4oz gloves in his UFC career, eagerly accepting the proposal.\n\nDespite criticism from notable boxing figures like Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin regarding the legitimacy of the matchup, NAC Executive Director Bob Bennett approved the fight. Bennett cited several factors: McGregor's impressive performance against Nate Diazâwho is highly regarded as a boxer by trainer Virgil Hunterâhis age advantage (being 12 years younger than Mayweather), and his physical attributes such as height and reach. He also noted Mayweather's lack of recent knockouts, with his last true knockout occurring in 2007 against Ricky Hatton.\n\nTo prepare for the transition from MMA to boxing, McGregor's team hired Hall of Fame referee Joe Cortez to help them understand boxing rules and etiquette. During training, an intense sparring session between McGregor and former two-weight world champion Paulie Malignaggi, overseen by Cortez, led to controversy. Images surfaced showing Malignaggi on the canvas, which he claimed were misleading, prompting him to leave McGregor's camp.\n\nThe fight is poised to be one of the richest in history, marking McGregor's professional boxing debut and adding to Mayweather's storied career. The NAC's upcoming decision on the glove size could impact the dynamics of the match, emphasizing the ongoing negotiations and preparations leading up to the highly anticipated event.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and about five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision compared to their more affluent peers committing the same offenses. Poverty also exacerbates the risk of violence among both boys and girls. While boys are generally three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, girls from poorer households are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime as those from wealthier backgrounds, even when accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision.\n\nThe research indicates that a history of trouble with the police is the strongest predictor of a young person being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18. It suggests that involvement with the juvenile justice system may inadvertently reinforce the conditions that perpetuate violence. Another study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) reveals that despite overall crime rates in Scotland reaching a 41-year low, the most deprived communities have not benefited from this decline. Crime remains highly concentrated among poor individuals and neighborhoods, which also suffer from high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about whether the Scottish government is effectively addressing inequality. In response, a government spokesman emphasized that Scotland has become safer, with significant reductions in recorded crime and homicide rates, and highlighted a Â£296 million investment aimed at mitigating poverty and inequality to protect the most vulnerable in society.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The exercise involves 10 NATO warships, including the USS Vicksburg and the Royal Navy's HMS Portland, working collaboratively to locate and track the German submarine U33, which is simulating an adversary. U33, commanded by Kai Nicklesdorf with a crew of 28, operates stealthily beneath the waves, posing a formidable challenge to the surface ships and highlighting the difficulty of detecting modern submarinesâoften compared to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nThe exercise underscores growing concerns about Russia's expanding and technologically advanced submarine fleet, now numbering around 60 vessels, including both nuclear-powered and diesel-electric submarines capable of operating in shallow waters. Russia has recently launched what it claims to be the \"quietest submarine in the world,\" further intensifying NATO's focus on submarine detection capabilities. Experts like Peter Roberts from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) recognize that Russian submarines are among the most advanced and elusive globally, with highly skilled crews capable of remaining undetected for extended periods while gathering intelligence on other nations' naval activities.\n\n\"Dynamic Mongoose\" also brings attention to the critical gaps in the United Kingdom's maritime defenses.

Critics argue that the First Family traditionally resides in the White House as a symbol to the nation and the world, while supporters commend her commitment to her son's education.\n\nHistorically, only two First Ladies, Martha Washington and Anna Harrison, did not reside in the White House during their husbands' presidencies, due to circumstances like the White House not yet being built or the president's untimely death.

These structures, possibly 2,000 years old, were concealed beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest and were revealed due to modern deforestation. The function of these geoglyphs remains uncertain; they are unlikely to be villages or defensive sites due to few artefacts found and their non-defensive layouts. Instead, they may have served as ritual gathering places, similar to Central America's Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. However, unlike those monuments, these geoglyphs were constructed among tall vegetation and were likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n\nDr. Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs, studying phytoliths to reconstruct ancient vegetation, charcoal quantities to assess forest burning, and carbon stable isotopes to determine past vegetation types. The research suggests that ancient peoples transformed their environment not by large-scale burning but by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms, indicating early agroforestry practices. This challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems untouched by humans before European arrival in the 16th century. The team likens this to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests today may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite increasing global instabilityâevidenced by mass migrations from failed states, the threat of Islamic extremism, and a more assertive Russiaâthe UK is reducing its military capabilities. The regular Army is shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy operates just 19 warships, and the Royal Air Force is down to eight, soon to be seven, front-line fast jet squadrons. Additionally, the UK has gaps in capabilities, such as lacking Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relying on NATO allies to monitor Russian submarines near its waters.\n\nDefence spending is declining, with the UK falling from the fourth to the sixth largest global defence spender, now trailing behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France. A significant point of contention is the commitment to NATO's guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defenceâa target only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledge to meet. Projections indicate UK defence spending may drop to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, or even 1.5% with further cuts.\n\nFuture governments are expected to implement additional defence budget reductions as they strive to decrease the national deficit. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), holding one of the largest unprotected budgets at Â£34 billion annually, faces potential cuts of Â£2-3 billion per year. While the Conservatives have committed to replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent, increasing the equipment budget by 1% annually, and maintaining army personnel levels, these promises constrain their ability to find savings without impacting their fiscal plans. Labour has avoided making similar commitments, and military leaders anticipate inevitable cuts.\n\nThe renewal of the Trident nuclear programme is a divisive issue. The Conservatives and UKIP support a full like-for-like replacement at an estimated cost of at least Â£20 billion, accounting for a quarter of the MoD's equipment budget over the next decade. Labour proposes maintaining continuous at-sea deterrence with potentially three submarines instead of four, the Liberal Democrats suggest a reduced \"part-time deterrent,\" and the SNP and Greens advocate for scrapping it entirely. This lack of consensus raises the possibility of further delays or revisions to the programme.\n\nThe UK is set to introduce two new aircraft carriersâthe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Walesâby the end of the decade. However, there are concerns about insufficient crew and aircraft to fully utilize these vessels. Plans to equip them with F-35 jets have been scaled back, with only 12 aircraft expected to be deployed despite the carriers' capacity for 36. Military leaders warn of a \"hollow force\" possessing advanced equipment but lacking adequate personnel.\n\nThese developments challenge the long-held notion that Britain can \"punch above its weight\" militarily on the global stage. Ongoing budget constraints and reductions in military capability raise concerns about the UK's future defence posture and its ability to respond to international threats effectively.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The APC's leader, Muhammadu Buhari, who previously defeated President Goodluck Jonathan in the presidential election, is set to be inaugurated on May 29.\n\nThe PDP lost control of key northern states, including Katsina and Kadunaâthe home state of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Samboâand Adamawa, which has been severely affected by Boko Haram's insurgency.

Overall, the PDP secured eight governorships, mainly in the southeast.\n\nAnalysts note that the APC's gains have transformed the political landscape, relegating the PDP to a regional party with strength primarily in the southeast and the Niger Delta. The APC now controls most northern states and Lagos, the commercial hub in the southwest. Despite these gains, the APC did not win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could pose challenges for President-elect Buhari, as militants in these regions might disrupt oil production and reduce crucial federal revenue.\n\nThe elections were marred by some violence due to intense rivalry, ethnic tensions, and the high stakes of power and resource control. Notably, incidents occurred in Rivers and other southern states, leading to extended voting times in some areas. Despite these issues, the elections were generally more peaceful than in previous years, indicating progress in Nigeria's democratic maturity.\n\nNigeria's governors hold significant power, often controlling budgets larger than those of neighboring countries' national governments, especially in oil-rich states.

Savage observes that Liverpool are currently far from the level required to contend for the Premier League title and may struggle to secure a top-four finish. This downturn is partly due to the team overachieving last season, which has led to unrealistic expectations among fans.\n\nSavage critiques manager Brendan Rodgers' transfer decisions, particularly in replacing strikers Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. The current forward optionsâMario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, and Fabio Boriniâare deemed insufficient, lacking both goal-scoring prowess and the high work-rate that characterized Liverpool's attack last season. This deficiency has resulted in a significant drop in early goals and a lack of pressing intensity, leaving the team often chasing games.\n\nDefensive frailties persist despite substantial investments in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The back line lacks leadership, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's hesitance to command his area exacerbates the issue. Set-piece effectiveness has also declined sharply, removing a crucial source of goals from the previous campaign.\n\nAhead of the clash with Chelsea, Savage proposes a lineup that includes Kolo Toure over Lovren, citing Toure's solid performance against Real Madrid. He emphasizes the need for disciplined full-backs and a dynamic midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling to challenge Chelsea's robust defense. However, Savage concedes that even with these adjustments, it's difficult to envision Liverpool defeating a Chelsea side that appears superior in all facets of the game.\n\nAddressing Steven Gerrard's situation, Savage acknowledges the psychological and physical hurdles the 34-year-old faces. Despite the infamous slip against Chelsea that marred last season and ongoing speculation about his future, Gerrard remains one of Liverpool's key players. Savage believes Gerrard's experience, skill set, and enduring fitness make him integral to the team's long-term plans. He commends Gerrard's resilience and continued contributions, underscoring his status as one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders.\n\nOverall, Savage's analysis underscores the significant challenges Liverpool face in replicating past successes and the critical decisions required to restore their competitiveness at the highest level.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Therefore, maintaining market access is crucial for a successful industry.\n\nThe report highlights that the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), though criticized by the UK fishing industry for its quotas and equal access principles, includes elements that should be retained post-Brexit, such as basing total allowable catches and quotas on scientific advice. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management within the UK's constituent nationsâEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nWhile acknowledging potential risks, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic.

The shortlisted authors are:\n\n- **Neel Mukherjee (UK)** for *The Lives of Others*, a novel set in 1960s Calcutta focusing on family secrets and political activism. Bookmakers William Hill have it as the favourite at 5/2 odds.\n- **Howard Jacobson (UK)** for *J*, a futuristic love story in a society where the past is suppressed. Jacobson previously won the Booker in 2010 for *The Finkler Question*.\n- **Ali Smith (UK)** for *How To Be Both*, which interweaves two storiesâone of a Renaissance artist in 15th-century Italy and one of a 1960s childâallowing readers to choose the order in which they read them.\n- **Joshua Ferris (USA)** for *To Rise Again at a Decent Hour*, exploring atheism through a New York dentist who discovers someone impersonating him online.\n- **Karen Joy Fowler (USA)** for *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*, narrated by college student Rosemary as she unveils her unique family story. It is the bestseller among the nominees, with over 55,000 copies sold since March.\n- **Richard Flanagan (Australia)** for *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*, a love story set against the backdrop of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway's construction during World War II. He stands at 3/1 odds with bookmakers.\n\nThe announcement has sparked discussions, with some critics like Professor David Brauner describing the list as \"weak\" and expressing concerns over potential biases in awarding repeat winners like Jacobson, especially after Hilary Mantel's recent double win.

The new approach introduced a three-route model:\n\n1. **Fast-Track Route**: Patients exhibiting clear \"alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers are given priority for rapid diagnosis and treatment with strict time targets.\n2. **Diagnosis Centres**: Established within existing hospitals and clinics, these centres offer quick access to a range of tests and scans for patients whose symptoms cannot be readily diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs), facilitating prompt identification of underlying conditions.\n3. **\"Yes-No\" Centres**: Designed for patients with minor symptoms unlikely to indicate cancer but warranting verification, these centres provide simple tests or scans to rule out serious diseases swiftly.\n\nThis reorganization improved patient diagnosis without overwhelming the healthcare system and led to enhanced cancer survival rates, bringing Denmark closer to its Scandinavian counterparts. A team of Welsh cancer specialists, GPs, NHS, and public health experts visited Aarhus to study this model.

Tourism in Greece is thriving, with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million, possibly due to travelers favoring Greece over regions near territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State. Greeks are not protesting against painful VAT increases, pension cuts, reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatizations, and increased competition in various sectors.\n\nThis lack of unrest may precede the revelation of the concessions Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has made to secure â¬86 billion in new credit from the eurozone and potentially the IMF, marking Greece's third bailout. Despite not fulfilling his promise to end fiscal austerity and the added strain of monetary austerity due to partial bank closures limiting lending, Tsipras remains remarkably popular. The economic situation is dire, with businesses lacking confidence to invest and potential shortages in retail due to credit constraints.\n\nGreece is enduring a severe economic squeeze that is likely to further impoverish its people. While the eurozone expresses relief at Syriza's concessions, the sustainability of the new bailout depends on Tsipras's ability to inspire hope for a better future. Many argue that genuine recovery requires creditors to significantly reduce Greece's unsustainably large debts by a third to a half. For the bailout to succeed, it is crucial for Brussels and Berlin to avoid triumphalism and to offer tangible debt forgiveness in response to Athens's capitulation.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

His approach, which included proprietary control over data, attracted both financial success and criticism for deviating from scientific norms of open access.\n\nWith his accumulated wealth, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006 to pursue the creation of synthetic life. After over a decade of research, his team published details of \"Synthia,\" the world's first synthetic organism, in the journal *Science*. Concurrently, Venter embarked on the Sorcerer II expedition, collecting and sequencing genomes from marine microbes to enhance understanding of gene and protein functions.\n\nDespite controversies, Venter remains focused on the potential of synthetic microbes to drive an industrial revolution.

By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to about 275 square kilometers, marking an average loss of 26%.

The retreat is not uniform across the region; southern sectors like the Belledonne Massif have seen glaciers nearly disappear, and the Ecrins Massif has experienced retreat over three times greater than that of the Mont Blanc Massif. Factors contributing to the greater losses in the south include lower elevations and different climatic conditions, such as less precipitation and cloud cover compared to the northern Alps.\n\nThe northern Alps, which receive more precipitation, have experienced less significant glacier retreat.

Fishing regions voted heavily for Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation akin to Norway. However, the industry contributes only 0.5% to the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority for the government.\n\nThe report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared with EU states, and the majority of UK-caught fish are exported to the EU, while much of the fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU countries. Continued access to the EU market is crucial for the industry's success but may come at the cost of allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\nThe Committee suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing quotas on scientific advice and cooperating with neighboring countries. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives are optimistic. They point to recent increases in allowable catches under the CFP as a positive sign and believe that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch shares and improved sustainable fisheries management. The government asserts its commitment to ensuring the fishing industry has maximum freedom to trade within the single market while reviewing fisheries management to maintain fair quotas and healthy marine environments.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the 1980s, while at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he recognized the importance of decoding genes but was frustrated by the slow, tedious processes involved. Adopting automated decoding machines and focusing on messenger RNA (instead of entire genomes), he dramatically increased the speed of gene sequencing. Despite criticism from some in the scientific community, including James Watson, Venter left the NIH in 1992 to found The Institute for Genomic Research.\n\nIn 1995, his team unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, *Haemophilus influenzae*. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics, aiming to sequence the human genome in just three yearsâa direct challenge to the publicly funded Human Genome Project's ten-year timeline.

For decades, she refrained from seeing them, even after the conviction of Jerome Sidney Barrett. However, she now regrets that decision.

In 2009, Barrett, then 68, was found guilty of second-degree murder in Marcia's case and was sentenced to 44 years by a Davidson County criminal court jury.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines heavy drinking as consuming more than one drink per day for women and more than two for men over the past month; binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase is largely driven by changing social norms affecting women's drinking habits. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women rose more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates increased nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared to a 23% increase among men.\n\nIn 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers, while the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained relatively unchanged. The study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, highlighted regional variations: Madison County, Idaho, had the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, whereas Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest at 36%; Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers at 2%, and Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most at 22%.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in excessive drinking, including increased alcohol advertising expenditures (about $3.45 billion in 2011), alcohol becoming cheaper due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, weakened alcohol control policies, and the influence of affluent professionals in urban areas who may engage in hard-partying lifestyles. Young people and wealthier individuals are more likely to binge drink, and changing social norms have made it more acceptable for women to drink heavily.\n\nAlcohol-related issues have significant societal costs, with approximately 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of excessive drinking exceeding $220 billion. While more individuals are seeking treatment for alcoholism, many do not seek help unless faced with serious consequences like job loss or legal issues.\n\nThe findings are based on data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older, collected through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In England, over 25% of women now give birth via caesarean, a rate that has more than doubled since the early 1990s.

The author challenges this perspective by highlighting that male leaders have historically made impulsive decisions influenced by hormones, referencing unnecessary wars and scandals involving politicians like George W. Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford, and John Edwards.\n\nThe discussion expands to the broader issue of gender bias in leadership and the workplace. Despite women outnumbering men in higher education and the workforce, persistent biases limit their potential. Examples include the underrepresentation of women on corporate boardsâwhere men named John, Robert, William, or James outnumber all women combinedâand the tendency for students to describe male professors as \"geniuses\" while labeling female professors as \"nice.\" The article cites insights from Wharton professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on the benefits of eradicating gender stereotypes.\n\nThe author points out that Hillary Clinton's path to the White House is steepened not by her capabilities but by ingrained gender biases. Emphasizing that equality benefits everyone, the article notes that organizations with more women in leadership perform better financially, and that shared responsibilities strengthen families and marriages. The piece concludes by remarking on the irony of Rios's threat to move to Canada if Clinton is elected, given that Canada had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The DES aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe findings support theories that galaxies form in areas with large concentrations of dark matter due to stronger gravitational forces. The maps reveal large filaments of matter where galaxies and clusters reside, as well as cosmic voids with few galaxies. Analyzing the clumpiness of dark matter will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to cause the accelerated expansion of the universe. The project involves analyzing 130 million images of galaxies, a task that requires substantial computational resources, including some of the world's most powerful supercomputers. As the survey progresses, researchers expect to better test cosmological theories by comparing the distributions of dark and visible matter.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The harassment ranged from verbal insults and intimidating behaviorsâsuch as insistent flirting, whistling, and comments on appearanceâto more severe offenses like sexual assault or rape. Many women remain unaware they have been harassed due to societal conditioning that normalizes low-level abuse.\n\nThese pervasive experiences have led six out of ten women to fear attacks on public transport, compared to three out of ten men. As a result, women often alter their daily routines by changing routes, modes of transportation, schedules, attitudes, and clothing to avoid confrontation, effectively limiting their freedom and participation in public life.

Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly affected. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two further increased the likelihood of being overweight, especially among boys, who were also found to be slightly taller than their peers who had not received antibiotics.\n\nThe study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria that normally aid in metabolism, potentially leading to increased appetite and weight gain. Although causation was not established, lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that such exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, which is more pronounced in boys. The findings align with concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics contributing to unintended health consequences, including obesity, eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, there is growing worry that antibiotic overuse may lead to the emergence of superbugs, with the government warning of a new strain that could infect up to 200,000 Britons and cause 80,000 deaths in a single outbreak.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

She journeyed from her feeding grounds near Russia's Sakhalin Island, crossed the Pacific Ocean, and traveled down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. This feat surpassed the previous record held by a humpback whale that migrated 10,190 miles. Scientists, including Bruce Mate from Oregon State University, were surprised to find that Varvara visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales. This unexpected behavior suggests that Varvara may actually be an eastern gray whale rather than a western gray whale as previously thought. The discovery has significant implications for the estimated population of western gray whales, which could be even lower than the believed 150 individuals, and indicates a need to reevaluate the genetic distinctions between eastern and western gray whale populations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He highlighted Chelsea's successful signings of Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, and Diego Costa as an example for Arsenal to follow.

In subsequent years, although improvements were made to the car's chassis, problems with the Honda power unit hindered performance.\n\nHistorically, McLaren's partnership with Honda in the late 1980s led to unparalleled success, including winning 15 out of 16 races in 1988 with legendary drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and about five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision compared to their more affluent peers committing the same offenses. Poverty also exacerbates the risk of violence among both boys and girls. While boys are generally three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, girls from poorer households are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime as those from wealthier backgrounds, even when accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision.\n\nThe research indicates that a history of trouble with the police is the strongest predictor of a young person being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18. It suggests that involvement with the juvenile justice system may inadvertently reinforce the conditions that perpetuate violence. Another study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) reveals that despite overall crime rates in Scotland reaching a 41-year low, the most deprived communities have not benefited from this decline. Crime remains highly concentrated among poor individuals and neighborhoods, which also suffer from high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about whether the Scottish government is effectively addressing inequality.

The exercise involves 10 NATO warships, including the USS Vicksburg and the Royal Navy's HMS Portland, working collaboratively to locate and track the German submarine U33, which is simulating an adversary. U33, commanded by Kai Nicklesdorf with a crew of 28, operates stealthily beneath the waves, posing a formidable challenge to the surface ships and highlighting the difficulty of detecting modern submarinesâoften compared to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nThe exercise underscores growing concerns about Russia's expanding and technologically advanced submarine fleet, now numbering around 60 vessels, including both nuclear-powered and diesel-electric submarines capable of operating in shallow waters. Russia has recently launched what it claims to be the \"quietest submarine in the world,\" further intensifying NATO's focus on submarine detection capabilities. Experts like Peter Roberts from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) recognize that Russian submarines are among the most advanced and elusive globally, with highly skilled crews capable of remaining undetected for extended periods while gathering intelligence on other nations' naval activities.\n\n\"Dynamic Mongoose\" also brings attention to the critical gaps in the United Kingdom's maritime defenses. Since the retirement of its Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft, the UK lacks dedicated long-range aircraft capable of anti-submarine surveillance, forcing reliance on NATO allies for aerial support when Russian submarines are suspected near British waters. This absence represents a key vulnerability, especially concerning the protection of the UK's nuclear deterrent as it departs from Faslane naval base in Scotland. The forthcoming government defense and security review is expected to address this shortfall. Overall, the exercise emphasizes the importance of international collaboration in enhancing anti-submarine warfare readiness, acknowledging that detecting modern Russian submarines is a complex challenge that demands advanced technology and coordinated efforts.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

An average of 2,500 refugees cross into Uganda daily, recounting harrowing experiences of killings, sexual violence, and ethnically targeted attacks.\n\nThe conflict, initially a power struggle between President Salva Kiir of the Dinka ethnic group and former Vice-President Riek Machar of the Nuer group, has evolved into widespread ethnic violence. Equatorians, who were not primary targets earlier, have been increasingly attacked since July. Refugees like Nelson Ladu Thomas describe atrocities committed against civilians, including murder and assault, particularly against men and boys, while women and girls face rape and other abuses.\n\nUganda has responded by providing land and resources to the influx of refugees. Families receive plots of land and materials to build shelters and cultivate crops within 36 hours of arrival. The Bidi Bidi settlement, once a village, has become one of the world's largest refugee camps, housing over a quarter of a million people across 250 square kilometers. Despite Uganda's generous efforts, the sheer number of refugeesânow nearing a millionâstrains resources, with challenges in providing essential services like water and education.\n\nHumanitarian agencies emphasize the urgency of international intervention to halt the violence in South Sudan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees highlights the dire situation, calling for global attention and pressure on South Sudanese leaders to stop what is described as a massacre of civilians on all sides.

These structures, possibly 2,000 years old, were concealed beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest and were revealed due to modern deforestation. The function of these geoglyphs remains uncertain; they are unlikely to be villages or defensive sites due to few artefacts found and their non-defensive layouts. Instead, they may have served as ritual gathering places, similar to Central America's Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. However, unlike those monuments, these geoglyphs were constructed among tall vegetation and were likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n\nDr. Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs, studying phytoliths to reconstruct ancient vegetation, charcoal quantities to assess forest burning, and carbon stable isotopes to determine past vegetation types. The research suggests that ancient peoples transformed their environment not by large-scale burning but by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms, indicating early agroforestry practices. This challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems untouched by humans before European arrival in the 16th century. The team likens this to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests today may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite increasing global instabilityâevidenced by mass migrations from failed states, the threat of Islamic extremism, and a more assertive Russiaâthe UK is reducing its military capabilities. The regular Army is shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy operates just 19 warships, and the Royal Air Force is down to eight, soon to be seven, front-line fast jet squadrons. Additionally, the UK has gaps in capabilities, such as lacking Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relying on NATO allies to monitor Russian submarines near its waters.\n\nDefence spending is declining, with the UK falling from the fourth to the sixth largest global defence spender, now trailing behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France. A significant point of contention is the commitment to NATO's guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defenceâa target only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledge to meet. Projections indicate UK defence spending may drop to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, or even 1.5% with further cuts.\n\nFuture governments are expected to implement additional defence budget reductions as they strive to decrease the national deficit. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), holding one of the largest unprotected budgets at Â£34 billion annually, faces potential cuts of Â£2-3 billion per year. While the Conservatives have committed to replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent, increasing the equipment budget by 1% annually, and maintaining army personnel levels, these promises constrain their ability to find savings without impacting their fiscal plans. Labour has avoided making similar commitments, and military leaders anticipate inevitable cuts.\n\nThe renewal of the Trident nuclear programme is a divisive issue. The Conservatives and UKIP support a full like-for-like replacement at an estimated cost of at least Â£20 billion, accounting for a quarter of the MoD's equipment budget over the next decade. Labour proposes maintaining continuous at-sea deterrence with potentially three submarines instead of four, the Liberal Democrats suggest a reduced \"part-time deterrent,\" and the SNP and Greens advocate for scrapping it entirely. This lack of consensus raises the possibility of further delays or revisions to the programme.\n\nThe UK is set to introduce two new aircraft carriersâthe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Walesâby the end of the decade. However, there are concerns about insufficient crew and aircraft to fully utilize these vessels. Plans to equip them with F-35 jets have been scaled back, with only 12 aircraft expected to be deployed despite the carriers' capacity for 36. Military leaders warn of a \"hollow force\" possessing advanced equipment but lacking adequate personnel.\n\nThese developments challenge the long-held notion that Britain can \"punch above its weight\" militarily on the global stage. Ongoing budget constraints and reductions in military capability raise concerns about the UK's future defence posture and its ability to respond to international threats effectively.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This marks the most substantial defeat for the People's Democratic Party (PDP) since the end of military rule in 1999. The APC's leader, Muhammadu Buhari, who previously defeated President Goodluck Jonathan in the presidential election, is set to be inaugurated on May 29.\n\nThe PDP lost control of key northern states, including Katsina and Kadunaâthe home state of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Samboâand Adamawa, which has been severely affected by Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP retained Rivers State, an important oil-producing area. Overall, the PDP secured eight governorships, mainly in the southeast.\n\nAnalysts note that the APC's gains have transformed the political landscape, relegating the PDP to a regional party with strength primarily in the southeast and the Niger Delta. The APC now controls most northern states and Lagos, the commercial hub in the southwest. Despite these gains, the APC did not win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could pose challenges for President-elect Buhari, as militants in these regions might disrupt oil production and reduce crucial federal revenue.\n\nThe elections were marred by some violence due to intense rivalry, ethnic tensions, and the high stakes of power and resource control. Notably, incidents occurred in Rivers and other southern states, leading to extended voting times in some areas. Despite these issues, the elections were generally more peaceful than in previous years, indicating progress in Nigeria's democratic maturity.\n\nNigeria's governors hold significant power, often controlling budgets larger than those of neighboring countries' national governments, especially in oil-rich states. The PDP faces a period of introspection and rebuilding under new leadership after 16 years in power. The party's decline was exacerbated by defections to the APC and widespread allegations of corruption and ineffective response to the Islamist insurgency in the northeast, where it suffered considerable defeats.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Savage observes that Liverpool are currently far from the level required to contend for the Premier League title and may struggle to secure a top-four finish. This downturn is partly due to the team overachieving last season, which has led to unrealistic expectations among fans.\n\nSavage critiques manager Brendan Rodgers' transfer decisions, particularly in replacing strikers Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. The current forward optionsâMario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, and Fabio Boriniâare deemed insufficient, lacking both goal-scoring prowess and the high work-rate that characterized Liverpool's attack last season. This deficiency has resulted in a significant drop in early goals and a lack of pressing intensity, leaving the team often chasing games.\n\nDefensive frailties persist despite substantial investments in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The back line lacks leadership, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's hesitance to command his area exacerbates the issue. Set-piece effectiveness has also declined sharply, removing a crucial source of goals from the previous campaign.\n\nAhead of the clash with Chelsea, Savage proposes a lineup that includes Kolo Toure over Lovren, citing Toure's solid performance against Real Madrid. He emphasizes the need for disciplined full-backs and a dynamic midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling to challenge Chelsea's robust defense. However, Savage concedes that even with these adjustments, it's difficult to envision Liverpool defeating a Chelsea side that appears superior in all facets of the game.\n\nAddressing Steven Gerrard's situation, Savage acknowledges the psychological and physical hurdles the 34-year-old faces. Despite the infamous slip against Chelsea that marred last season and ongoing speculation about his future, Gerrard remains one of Liverpool's key players. Savage believes Gerrard's experience, skill set, and enduring fitness make him integral to the team's long-term plans. He commends Gerrard's resilience and continued contributions, underscoring his status as one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders.\n\nOverall, Savage's analysis underscores the significant challenges Liverpool face in replicating past successes and the critical decisions required to restore their competitiveness at the highest level.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The goal is to provide broadband internet access to every corner of the globe, with a particular focus on connecting all schools. To achieve this, Airbus is revolutionizing satellite manufacturing by adopting high-volume, low-cost production methods akin to automobile and airplane assembly lines. This approach aims to produce three satellites per shift at a cost of less than a million dollars each.\n\nThe first assembly line has been inaugurated in Toulouse, France, with two additional lines planned for a new factory in Florida. The project entails the most extensive rocket launch campaign in spaceflight history, utilizing over 20 Soyuz rockets to deploy clusters of 32-36 satellites into orbit at an altitude of 1,200 km. OneWeb plans to have nearly 300 satellites operational by the end of 2020 or early 2021, over 600 a year later, and more than 800 by the middle of the decade.\n\nWhile other companies like SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat are pursuing similar mega-constellations, OneWeb believes it has a first-mover advantage, having already raised $1.7 billion in equity and seeking additional funding to complete the rollout. Registered in the UK's Channel Islands, OneWeb collaborates with the UK Space Agency for licensing and emphasizes its significant economic impact on the UK, including fostering a local ecosystem and advancing regulatory leadership.\n\nAddressing concerns about space debris, OneWeb commits to setting new standards in debris mitigation by de-orbiting its satellites within two years, surpassing the five-year guideline suggested by recent studies. The satellites are equipped with extra hardware to enhance the reliability of the de-orbit process and include adapters that allow for retrieval by a \"chase vehicle\" if necessary.\n\nAirbus and OneWeb anticipate that their innovative manufacturing methods will disrupt the satellite industry and hope to produce satellites for other companies. However, they acknowledge that while mass production is suitable for certain applications, bespoke, \"gold-plated\" satellites will remain essential for specialized missions, such as deep-space exploration.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

However, the committee emphasizes the industry's importance, noting that most commercial fish stocks are shared with EU countries, the majority of UK-caught fish are exported primarily to the EU, and a significant portion of fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU states. Therefore, maintaining market access is crucial for a successful industry.\n\nThe report highlights that the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), though criticized by the UK fishing industry for its quotas and equal access principles, includes elements that should be retained post-Brexit, such as basing total allowable catches and quotas on scientific advice. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management within the UK's constituent nationsâEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nWhile acknowledging potential risks, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic. Recent increases in allowable catches for species like plaice, haddock, and prawns under the CFP are seen as positive indicators. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, expressed confidence that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch opportunities and better sustainable fisheries management, benefiting coastal communities.\n\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson reiterated the aim to secure maximum freedom for British companies to trade within the single market while viewing Brexit as an opportunity to review fisheries management.

This issue stems from the lack of integration between local electoral registers and the online registration system, which use different databases and cannot communicate directly.

This caused administrative and financial burdens for electoral officials.\n\nThe Commission recommends better coordination between electoral registers to identify duplicate entries and suggests introducing verification functions on registration sites, similar to systems in Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. They also propose that individuals registered in multiple constituencies should choose in advance where they will vote in future elections to reduce the risk of double voting.\n\nLabour warned against reacting hastily and stressed that measures to prevent double voting should not make it harder for young people and students to register. They cautioned that a blanket ban on being registered at two addresses could disenfranchise those who need to be registered in multiple locations for work or study.

Embracing new technology, he acquired an automated decoding machine and innovated by focusing on messenger RNA, allowing for rapid gene sequencing. Despite criticism from prominent scientists like James Watson and challenges in securing public funding, he left NIH in 1992 to establish The Institute for Genomic Research. In 1995, he unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, *Haemophilus influenzae*.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics with the ambitious goal of sequencing the entire human genome in just three years, directly competing with the publicly funded Human Genome Project. Both initiatives published their findings in 2001. His approach, which included proprietary control over data, attracted both financial success and criticism for deviating from scientific norms of open access.\n\nWith his accumulated wealth, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006 to pursue the creation of synthetic life. After over a decade of research, his team published details of \"Synthia,\" the world's first synthetic organism, in the journal *Science*. Concurrently, Venter embarked on the Sorcerer II expedition, collecting and sequencing genomes from marine microbes to enhance understanding of gene and protein functions.\n\nDespite controversies, Venter remains focused on the potential of synthetic microbes to drive an industrial revolution.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, glaciers descending from Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains covered approximately 375 square kilometers. By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to about 275 square kilometers, marking an average loss of 26%. The research, conducted by Marie Gardent and colleagues from the University of Savoie, assessed around 600 glaciers across several massifs, including Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nUsing historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, the team verified glacier boundaries through manual inspection to account for issues like debris cover and shadowing that can affect automatic delineation methods. The retreat is not uniform across the region; southern sectors like the Belledonne Massif have seen glaciers nearly disappear, and the Ecrins Massif has experienced retreat over three times greater than that of the Mont Blanc Massif. Factors contributing to the greater losses in the south include lower elevations and different climatic conditions, such as less precipitation and cloud cover compared to the northern Alps.\n\nThe northern Alps, which receive more precipitation, have experienced less significant glacier retreat. For instance, France's largest glacier, La Mer de Glace on Mont Blanc, has seen a slight area reduction from 31.5 square kilometers in the late 1960s to just over 30 square kilometers in the late 2000s. This study mirrors findings in other parts of the Alps, including Switzerland, where accelerated glacier mass loss has also been reported.

Fishing regions voted heavily for Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation akin to Norway. However, the industry contributes only 0.5% to the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority for the government.\n\nThe report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared with EU states, and the majority of UK-caught fish are exported to the EU, while much of the fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU countries. Continued access to the EU market is crucial for the industry's success but may come at the cost of allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\nThe Committee suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing quotas on scientific advice and cooperating with neighboring countries. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives are optimistic.

Born in 1946, he initially showed little academic promise and spent his youth surfing in Southern California. Drafted into the Vietnam War in 1967, his experiences as a naval hospital orderly during the Tet Offensive inspired him to pursue medicine and instilled in him a sense of urgency about life's brevity.\n\nDuring his medical training, Venter excelled in research. In the 1980s, while at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he recognized the importance of decoding genes but was frustrated by the slow, tedious processes involved. Adopting automated decoding machines and focusing on messenger RNA (instead of entire genomes), he dramatically increased the speed of gene sequencing. Despite criticism from some in the scientific community, including James Watson, Venter left the NIH in 1992 to found The Institute for Genomic Research.\n\nIn 1995, his team unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, *Haemophilus influenzae*. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics, aiming to sequence the human genome in just three yearsâa direct challenge to the publicly funded Human Genome Project's ten-year timeline. Both projects published their results in 2001. While some criticized Venter for his commercial approach and lack of open data sharing, his efforts undeniably accelerated genomic research.\n\nWith substantial financial resources, Venter established the J.

Concurrently, he embarked on the Sorcerer II expedition, collecting and sequencing oceanic microorganisms to enhance understanding of gene and protein functions.\n\nDespite controversies, Venter believes synthetic microbes could spark a new industrial revolution by reducing dependence on oil and mitigating environmental damage through carbon capture.

Only 20% of employers in England offer apprenticeships, contrasted with 51% in Germany, which has one of the best vocational education systems. The report notes that England's vocational system is overly complex with 18,000 different qualifications, whereas Germany has just 330.\n\nSince 2010, over half (58%) of English apprenticeships have been below level three, and three-quarters are aimed at those over 25, many already employed. Young people face stiff competition, with 11 applicants for each apprenticeship. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, calls for a radical expansion of higher-level apprenticeshipsâup to 300,000 new starts annually, primarily at level three and above, lasting at least three years. He emphasizes that quality apprenticeships are crucial for social mobility and that the current system hinders economic competitiveness and access to skilled jobs for young people.\n\nThe Department for Education responds that it is reforming apprenticeships to improve standards, including making them more rigorous and ensuring they last a minimum of a year with increased focus on English and maths. The Association of Colleges agrees on prioritizing level three apprenticeships but argues that respected level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, should be preserved.

Analysts note that the PDP's decline is due to a lack of national voter support, allegations of corruption, and an inability to address the Islamist insurgency in the northeast. The APC's failure to win any of the five oil-producing states raises concerns for the incoming administration regarding potential disruptions to oil production by militant groups.

The team's downturn began in 2013 due to issues with chassis design, despite having the best engine at the time. Currently, while improvements have been made to the car, the team struggles with the Honda power unit.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with McLaren's past successes, particularly during their previous partnership with Honda in the late 1980s. In 1988, with drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they dominated the season by winning 15 out of 16 races. After a period of dominance, McLaren experienced fluctuations in performance, including a significant dip before achieving success again with Mika HÃ¤kkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99. Notably, their last constructors' title was in 1998.\n\nThe team has faced scandals, such as the 2007 spying incident involving Ferrari's technical information, which led to their exclusion from the constructors' championship and a hefty fine. Another incident in 2009, known as \"lie-gate,\" involved Lewis Hamilton and led to public apologies and staff changes. Despite winning races until 2012, McLaren has not secured a championship title since Hamilton's in 2008.\n\nRon Dennis, who returned to lead the team after the 2013 season, is confident that McLaren will soon break Mercedes' dominance and return to winning championships. Fernando Alonso rejoined McLaren in 2015, believing that the renewed partnership with Honda offered the best chance to win another title. However, progress has been slow, and the team currently relies on the belief that success is imminent. This optimism is crucial not only for Alonso's aspirations to secure a third championship but also for maintaining the legacy of McLaren as one of Formula One's most esteemed teams.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This condition causes RJ's skin to appear red, inflamed, and scaly, often resembling severe burns or sunburn. To manage his painful symptoms, Valerie must regularly apply creams like Vaseline to his skin multiple times a day to prevent it from drying out and cracking.\n\nDue to RJ's appearance, Valerie and her son have faced significant misunderstanding and discrimination. While shopping, they were once surrounded by armed police officers after a stranger mistakenly reported her for child abuse, believing she had scalded her son. They have also been denied entry to play centers and are frequently subjected to taunts and accusations, mostly from adults who assume RJ is burned or contagious. Despite these challenges, Valerie describes RJ as a beautiful, bubbly, and happy child with a cheeky smile who loves playing ball.\n\nValerie initially struggled to find a diagnosis for RJ's condition after noticing his skin issues at birth. Doctors were unable to identify the problem, leading her to seek answers online. She eventually discovered a Facebook group for Netherton's syndrome, founded by parents of a child with the same condition, which provided her with valuable information and support.\n\nNetherton's syndrome is a genetic skin disorder that can appear without any family history. It causes the skin to lose heat, water, and protein rapidly, making infants more susceptible to infections. Symptoms often include red, scaly skin that can be itchy, sensitive, or raw. There is no cure, but symptoms can improve over time with proper skin care management. Valerie hopes that increased awareness of the condition will reduce stigma and misconceptions, allowing RJ to lead a more accepted and inclusive life. RJ's siblings are supportive, helping him and standing up against bullies, and Valerie remains devoted to caring for her son despite the hardships.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines heavy drinking as consuming more than one drink per day for women and more than two for men over the past month; binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase is largely driven by changing social norms affecting women's drinking habits. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women rose more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates increased nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared to a 23% increase among men.\n\nIn 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers, while the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained relatively unchanged. The study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, highlighted regional variations: Madison County, Idaho, had the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, whereas Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest at 36%; Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers at 2%, and Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most at 22%.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in excessive drinking, including increased alcohol advertising expenditures (about $3.45 billion in 2011), alcohol becoming cheaper due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, weakened alcohol control policies, and the influence of affluent professionals in urban areas who may engage in hard-partying lifestyles. Young people and wealthier individuals are more likely to binge drink, and changing social norms have made it more acceptable for women to drink heavily.\n\nAlcohol-related issues have significant societal costs, with approximately 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of excessive drinking exceeding $220 billion. While more individuals are seeking treatment for alcoholism, many do not seek help unless faced with serious consequences like job loss or legal issues.\n\nThe findings are based on data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older, collected through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In England, over 25% of women now give birth via caesarean, a rate that has more than doubled since the early 1990s.

This versatile styleâranging from denim and cropped to printed and striped variationsâexudes an effortless appeal. Fashion figures like Louise Redknapp suggest that while the wide-leg can be daunting, especially for shorter individuals, the key to mastering the look lies in styling. Pairing these trousers with high heels, particularly those that expose the top of the foot, can elongate the legs. Keeping the top half of the outfit simpleâusing a knit, shirt, or teeâmaintains proportion and prevents the ensemble from looking costume-like. High-waisted and long-length options add extra leg length. Designers such as Gucci, CÃ©line, and Stella McCartney have embraced the trend in their collections, with Gucci revisiting 1970s-inspired flared jeans. High-street brands like Topshop have also introduced styles like the 1970s-inspired \"Miller\" jean.

Among women, three-quarters reported never washing their own vehicles, opting instead for local car wash services. Contributing factors to this decline include the rise of Sunday shopping, increased live football on TV, the availability of affordable hand car washes, and larger vehicle sizes like 4x4s that are more challenging to clean. Furthermore, only 5% of respondents have asked their children to wash the car for extra pocket money. During holidays such as Easter, there's a surge in car washing by ownersâan estimated 15 million carsâthough a quarter admit doing it merely to get out of the house. The practice of self-washing is most common in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least common in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Owners of Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs are more likely to wash their own cars, while those with Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are less inclined. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley commented that while car washing was once a national Sunday tradition, modern lifestyles, larger cars, disinterest from children, and convenient alternatives have led to its decline.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Officials expect the number of HIV cases to continue rising as more people undergo testing.\n\nThe future of the needle exchange program is uncertain. Governor Pence, who generally opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing whether to extend the program beyond its April 25 end date. Concurrently, legislation proposed by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere aims to allow 23 Indiana counties with high hepatitis C ratesâa key indicator of potential HIV outbreaksâto establish their own needle exchange programs.

Additional projects, such as waterproofing the receiving vault and landscaping improvements, are underway.\n\nThe tomb, designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead and dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874, has undergone reconstructions in 1899 and 1930 to address foundational issues and enhance public access. It is a circular structure topped with an obelisk, featuring an interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble trimmed with bronze. Hallways lead to the family burial chamber, where Lincoln rests beneath the inscription, \"Now he belongs to the ages.\"\n\nVisitors like William Sparks disagree with the magazine's assessment, praising the tomb as \"absolutely gorgeous\" and \"very impressive,\" despite not being able to view the interior due to reduced hours.

Researchers from the University of Manchester, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, spent two years measuring the shapes of galaxies to construct the map, which was released at the American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570-megapixel imaging device used in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) based at the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.\n\nCovering about 0.4% of the sky, the map displays clumps of dark matter by detecting the distortion of light from distant galaxiesâa phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Since dark matter does not emit or block light, its presence is inferred from these gravitational effects. The DES aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe findings support theories that galaxies form in areas with large concentrations of dark matter due to stronger gravitational forces. The maps reveal large filaments of matter where galaxies and clusters reside, as well as cosmic voids with few galaxies. Analyzing the clumpiness of dark matter will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to cause the accelerated expansion of the universe.

The harassment ranged from verbal insults and intimidating behaviorsâsuch as insistent flirting, whistling, and comments on appearanceâto more severe offenses like sexual assault or rape. Many women remain unaware they have been harassed due to societal conditioning that normalizes low-level abuse.\n\nThese pervasive experiences have led six out of ten women to fear attacks on public transport, compared to three out of ten men. As a result, women often alter their daily routines by changing routes, modes of transportation, schedules, attitudes, and clothing to avoid confrontation, effectively limiting their freedom and participation in public life. The report, presented to the French women's rights ministry, calls for campaigns to combat sexist and threatening behavior on buses and trains.\n\nPascale Boistard, president of the High Council for Gender Equalityâwhich compiled the reportâexpressed surprise at the widespread nature of the problem and affirmed that women must be able to move freely without fear or threat. Ernestine Ronai, also from the council, noted that attackers often feel they can act with impunity by blending into crowds. She emphasized the importance of educating women that such experiences are not normal and stressed that touching someone inappropriately constitutes sexual assault, punishable by up to five years in prison and a â¬75,005 fine.

Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly affected. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two further increased the likelihood of being overweight, especially among boys, who were also found to be slightly taller than their peers who had not received antibiotics.\n\nThe study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria that normally aid in metabolism, potentially leading to increased appetite and weight gain. Although causation was not established, lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that such exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, which is more pronounced in boys. The findings align with concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics contributing to unintended health consequences, including obesity, eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, there is growing worry that antibiotic overuse may lead to the emergence of superbugs, with the government warning of a new strain that could infect up to 200,000 Britons and cause 80,000 deaths in a single outbreak.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and tenth holesâprompting him to throw his putter at his bagâhe recovered with a birdie on the 11th and an eagle on the 13th after a towering four iron from 229 yards. Having ruptured a ligament in his left ankle in July, which sidelined him for several tournaments, McIlroy is aiming for his third Race to Dubai title in four years and currently leads England's Danny Willett by 271,214 points with three events remaining after the Turkish Open. English players Chris Wood (-13) and Richard Bland (-12), who were tied for second overnight, are now fifth and seventh respectively.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite opposition from hardliners led by Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in power since 1971 and opposes the dialogue process, Sheikh Salman insists that now is the time for dialogue and negotiations.\n\nHe acknowledged that many young protesters have lost faith in the main opposition parties, feeling that seeking permission to demonstrate or calling for a constitutional monarchy under the current ruling family is ineffective, especially as they accuse the family of ongoing violence. Sheikh Salman recalled that hours before Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) troops were deployed to suppress dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and the opposition had agreed on a seven-point plan to move Bahrain toward a constitutional monarchy. The arrival of GCC troops, however, severed this dialogue.\n\nRegarding international involvement, Sheikh Salman expressed hope that newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would \"do more than his predecessor\" by exerting clearer and more direct pressure on Bahrain for human rights and democratic practices. He criticized the UK government's approach, urging Prime Minister David Cameron to speak out publicly against violence and human rights abuses rather than relying on private communications, which he says have been ineffective.\n\nDespite a ban on public gatherings in Bahrain, Sheikh Salman reiterated al-Wefaq's commitment to calling for \"peaceful demonstrations\" as the only way to pressure the government. He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists sentenced to long prison terms based on evidence widely accepted as obtained under torture. He stressed that their inclusion in the dialogue is essential for its success, warning that without them, the dialogue will fail.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed it for approximately 30 years, bringing the ensemble to six continents. Under his leadership, the AAM made over 200 CDs, including the first complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. One of his most famous recordings is the 1980 version of Handel's *Messiah* with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by **BBC Music Magazine** as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.\n\nEducated at Cambridge University, Hogwood studied keyboard with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts, and later with Zuzana RÅ¯Å¾iÄkovÃ¡ and Gustav Leonhardt. Early in his career, he served as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner and was a founding member of the Early Music Consort of London.\n\nHogwood held several prominent positions, including artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also an educator, serving as a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge, and professor-at-large at Cornell University in the United States.\n\nColleagues and admirers paid tribute to Hogwood's legacy. Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, praised his \"extraordinary generosity of spirit\" and called him \"a great ambassador for historically informed music.\" Richard Egarr, the AAM's music director, expressed deep sadness at his passing and acknowledged the \"fantastic legacy\" Hogwood provided.

Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, stated that Russia should not be restricted from accepting territories whose people clearly wish to join Russia.\n\nThe second bill aims to expedite the process for Ukrainians to obtain Russian citizenship. It removes requirements such as paying a state tax, previous residence in Russia, sufficient funds for self-support, and renouncing Ukrainian citizenship. The preamble of this bill mentions support for \"the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" referencing World War Two fascists.\n\nThese legislative efforts coincide with the fact that many in Crimea, particularly in Sevastopolâthe base of the Russian Black Sea Fleetâalready hold Russian passports. The initiatives also follow Russia's actions in regions like Abkhazia and South Ossetia after the 2008 war with Georgia, where Russia supported pro-Russian separatists. Additionally, prominent Russian MPs and celebrities, including Irina Rodnina, Valentina Tereshkova, and Nikolai Valuev, have visited Crimea, underscoring Russia's heightened involvement in the region.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The team's slump began in 2013 due to struggles with chassis design, despite having the best engine at the time. In subsequent years, although improvements were made to the car's chassis, problems with the Honda power unit hindered performance.\n\nHistorically, McLaren's partnership with Honda in the late 1980s led to unparalleled success, including winning 15 out of 16 races in 1988 with legendary drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. They continued to dominate into the early 1990s before experiencing a downturn. A resurgence occurred in 1998-99 with Mika HÃ¤kkinen and Mercedes engines, but the team's last constructors' title was in 1998.\n\nThe team has also endured scandals, notably in 2007 when they were fined $100 million and excluded from the constructors' championship for possessing confidential Ferrari technical information. Another incident in 2009, dubbed \"lie-gate,\" involved driver Lewis Hamilton and led to internal shake-ups.\n\nRon Dennis, who has been integral to McLaren since taking control in the early 1980s, returned in 2014 to reverse the team's fortunes. Despite having world champions like Fernando Alonso, arguably one of the best drivers on the grid, McLaren has struggled to regain its former glory. Dennis remains confident that success is imminent and believes McLaren will be the next team to break Mercedes' dominance in the sport.\n\nThe team's current predicament raises questions about whether they are in a state of terminal decline or poised for a comeback. McLaren's leadership asserts that with continued development and improvements to both the car and the Honda power unit, they will once again achieve championship success. The future of the team, as well as the legacy of its star drivers, hinges on their ability to translate this belief into on-track results.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Players become guardians in a world where light has been stolen, embarking on quests to rediscover lost Bible stories, including special Christmas content about the birth of Jesus, to bring light back to the world.\n\n3. **Modern Nativity Videos**: Creative retellings of the nativity story are gaining traction online. Notably, Viral.de's 2010 video \"The Digital Story of Nativity\" narrates the birth of Jesus through modern social media updates and has amassed nearly six million views. Similarly, the Churches Advertising Network produced \"Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle,\" showing a couple transitioning through eras to become Mary and Joseph, emphasizing that the essence of Christmas remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Manga Messiah by Next Manga**: After significant success with printed manga-style Bible stories, Next Manga released digital versions of their works, including \"Manga Messiah,\" which portrays the nativity story. Available in 33 languages, they've distributed thousands of copies globally, including 25,000 in Arabic to Syrian and Libyan refugees, aiming to share a message of hope and peace.\n\n5. **Social Media Engagement**: Churches and Christian organizations are increasingly using platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with communities during the festive season. By sharing inspirational thoughts and encouraging people to reflect on spiritual matters, they adapt to contemporary communication methods. Some leaders suggest that if Jesus were here today, he'd utilize social media to spread his message due to his role as a great communicator.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate how technology and digital platforms can enrich the spiritual experience of Christmas, making it accessible and engaging for a modern audience while preserving its traditional messages.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The charity Fresh Start Housing, founded by the same individual, Samir Patel, refers clients from London homeless charities to Investing Solutions. Although both organizations operate legally, homeless groups have criticized their relationship, labeling it \"a new low.\"\n\nInvesting Solutions profits by placing several unrelated tenants in a single property and claiming housing benefit for each individual, rather than for the property as a whole.

Bennett cited several factors: McGregor's impressive performance against Nate Diazâwho is highly regarded as a boxer by trainer Virgil Hunterâhis age advantage (being 12 years younger than Mayweather), and his physical attributes such as height and reach. He also noted Mayweather's lack of recent knockouts, with his last true knockout occurring in 2007 against Ricky Hatton.\n\nTo prepare for the transition from MMA to boxing, McGregor's team hired Hall of Fame referee Joe Cortez to help them understand boxing rules and etiquette.

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and about five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision compared to their more affluent peers committing the same offenses. Poverty also exacerbates the risk of violence among both boys and girls. While boys are generally three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, girls from poorer households are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime as those from wealthier backgrounds, even when accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision.\n\nThe research indicates that a history of trouble with the police is the strongest predictor of a young person being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18. It suggests that involvement with the juvenile justice system may inadvertently reinforce the conditions that perpetuate violence. Another study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) reveals that despite overall crime rates in Scotland reaching a 41-year low, the most deprived communities have not benefited from this decline. Crime remains highly concentrated among poor individuals and neighborhoods, which also suffer from high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about whether the Scottish government is effectively addressing inequality.

Key among these are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the pro-Russian Cyber Berkut, and the Russian activist group Anonymous International.\n\n**Ukrainian Cyber Troops**: Led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin, this pro-Ukrainian hacker group targets Russian interests. They claim to have hacked Russian interior ministry servers and police emails, allegedly uncovering evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine. Utilizing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, they disable rebel websites and disrupt separatist funding by targeting electronic payment systems like PayPal and WebMoney. They also monitor troop movements by hacking into public CCTV systems in rebel-held eastern Ukraine and have hijacked network printers to disseminate pro-Ukrainian messages and messages insulting Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials deny using information from hackers for military operations.\n\n**Cyber Berkut**: A pro-Russian group named after the former Ukrainian riot police, Cyber Berkut opposes Ukraine's government and Western influence. Their activities aim to thwart Ukrainian military plans, which they describe as \"genocide\" instigated by the West. During U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev, they hacked Ukrainian government websites, displaying messages accusing him of supporting fascists. They claim to have obtained confidential U.S. documents detailing military assistance to Ukraine by hacking a mobile device from Biden's team. Cyber Berkut has also hijacked electronic billboards in Kiev to display graphic anti-government content, disrupted electronic vote-counting systems before parliamentary elections, leaked alleged defense ministry data on losses and desertions, and claimed responsibility for blocking President Petro Poroshenko's website. They assert possession of hacked communications suggesting Ukrainian forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, though this remains unverified.\n\n**Anonymous International (b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay)**: This Russian activist group is known for leaking Kremlin documents. It is unclear whether they obtain materials through hacking or from insiders. While focusing on Russia's domestic affairs, they have released content related to Ukraine, including a letter from a Russian fighter indicating a lack of local support for separatist forces and leaked emails involving Igor Girkin (also known as Strelkov), a former Russian FSB colonel and key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Their website is currently blocked in Russia.\n\nThe passage underscores the extent to which cyber warfare has become a tool for both sides in the Ukraine conflict, used to influence public opinion, gather intelligence, and disrupt adversary activities.

Between 2006 and 2011, Google paid Â£10 million in UK corporate taxes. Schmidt emphasized that if the UK government wants companies to pay more taxes, it should change its tax laws, and Google would comply accordingly. Meanwhile, Margaret Hodge, head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, proposed the creation of a new committee to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms, potentially allowing evidence to be heard in secret to prevent companies from hiding behind confidentiality rules. Google has been criticized for minimizing its UK tax payments by routing most of its UK sales through Ireland. European Union leaders recently agreed to combat tax avoidance through automatic information exchange between tax authorities. Schmidt has argued that corporate taxes should be levied where companies conduct economic activity and take risks, rather than where products are consumed, and has called for a debate on international tax reform. He believes that politicians should set clear tax rules, enabling companies that abide by the law to operate without confusion.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Nicknamed \"The Invisible Man\" due to his low profile, Temperton penned some of Jackson's most iconic songs, including \"Off The Wall,\" \"Rock With You,\" \"Burn This Disco Out,\" \"Thriller,\" \"Baby Be Mine,\" and \"The Lady in My Life.\" These tracks were integral to the success of Jackson's albums *Off The Wall* and *Thriller*, the latter becoming the best-selling album of all time in the U.S. with 32 million copies sold.\n\nBorn in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton attributed his musical passion to his father, who placed a transistor radio in his crib, allowing him to fall asleep listening to Radio Luxembourg. After working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, he answered an advertisement for a keyboardist in *Melody Maker* magazine and joined the disco group Heatwave. With Heatwave, he wrote hits like \"Boogie Nights,\" \"Always & Forever,\" and \"Groove Line,\" which became significant successes in the 1970s.\n\nTemperton's songwriting talents caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones, leading to their collaboration on Michael Jackson's albums. Beyond Jackson, his songs were recorded by artists such as Anita Baker, Donna Summer, Aretha Franklin, and The Brothers Johnson. In 1990, he won a Grammy Award for his work on \"Birdland\" from Quincy Jones's album *Back on the Block*, and in 1986, he received two Oscar nominations for his contributions to the soundtrack of *The Color Purple*.\n\nFollowing his passing, numerous artists paid tribute to Temperton. Nile Rodgers praised him for making \"a funkier world,\" LaToya Jackson and Mark Ronson expressed their admiration on social media, and Chaka Khan thanked him for his \"superlative songwriting.\" BBC radio presenter Gilles Peterson remarked, \"Apart from Lennon and McCartney, no one from the UK has written more gold-plated songs than Sir Rod Temperton.\"\n\nTemperton once summarized his approach to songwriting: \"The first criteria is write something you love first, and once you feel those hairs standing up on the back of your hand, you can go to the world.\" His funeral was private, and his family requested privacy during their time of grief.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These structures, possibly 2,000 years old, were concealed beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest and were revealed due to modern deforestation. The function of these geoglyphs remains uncertain; they are unlikely to be villages or defensive sites due to few artefacts found and their non-defensive layouts. Instead, they may have served as ritual gathering places, similar to Central America's Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. However, unlike those monuments, these geoglyphs were constructed among tall vegetation and were likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n\nDr. Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs, studying phytoliths to reconstruct ancient vegetation, charcoal quantities to assess forest burning, and carbon stable isotopes to determine past vegetation types. The research suggests that ancient peoples transformed their environment not by large-scale burning but by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms, indicating early agroforestry practices. This challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems untouched by humans before European arrival in the 16th century. The team likens this to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests today may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite increasing global instabilityâevidenced by mass migrations from failed states, the threat of Islamic extremism, and a more assertive Russiaâthe UK is reducing its military capabilities. The regular Army is shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy operates just 19 warships, and the Royal Air Force is down to eight, soon to be seven, front-line fast jet squadrons. Additionally, the UK has gaps in capabilities, such as lacking Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relying on NATO allies to monitor Russian submarines near its waters.\n\nDefence spending is declining, with the UK falling from the fourth to the sixth largest global defence spender, now trailing behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France. A significant point of contention is the commitment to NATO's guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defenceâa target only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledge to meet. Projections indicate UK defence spending may drop to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, or even 1.5% with further cuts.\n\nFuture governments are expected to implement additional defence budget reductions as they strive to decrease the national deficit. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), holding one of the largest unprotected budgets at Â£34 billion annually, faces potential cuts of Â£2-3 billion per year. While the Conservatives have committed to replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent, increasing the equipment budget by 1% annually, and maintaining army personnel levels, these promises constrain their ability to find savings without impacting their fiscal plans. Labour has avoided making similar commitments, and military leaders anticipate inevitable cuts.\n\nThe renewal of the Trident nuclear programme is a divisive issue. The Conservatives and UKIP support a full like-for-like replacement at an estimated cost of at least Â£20 billion, accounting for a quarter of the MoD's equipment budget over the next decade. Labour proposes maintaining continuous at-sea deterrence with potentially three submarines instead of four, the Liberal Democrats suggest a reduced \"part-time deterrent,\" and the SNP and Greens advocate for scrapping it entirely. This lack of consensus raises the possibility of further delays or revisions to the programme.\n\nThe UK is set to introduce two new aircraft carriersâthe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Walesâby the end of the decade. However, there are concerns about insufficient crew and aircraft to fully utilize these vessels. Plans to equip them with F-35 jets have been scaled back, with only 12 aircraft expected to be deployed despite the carriers' capacity for 36. Military leaders warn of a \"hollow force\" possessing advanced equipment but lacking adequate personnel.\n\nThese developments challenge the long-held notion that Britain can \"punch above its weight\" militarily on the global stage. Ongoing budget constraints and reductions in military capability raise concerns about the UK's future defence posture and its ability to respond to international threats effectively.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Mighty alleges that Olam purchases 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers, creating a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" by sourcing from unknown producers who may engage in illegal slash-and-burn methods. They also claim Olam is involved in deforestation in Gabon by clearing rainforests for monoculture palm oil plantations.\n\nBoth Olam and Temasek reject these allegations. Olam's CEO, Sunny Verghese, states that the company has a strict \"no burn-no peat-no deforestation\" policy and is committed to responsible sourcing, having recently released the names of its 14 suppliers. He acknowledges that vetting suppliers thoroughly will take several years and assures that non-compliant producers will be removed from their supply chain. Temasek emphasizes that it supports no-burn policies but does not direct the operations of its portfolio companies.\n\nThe situation highlights ongoing tensions in the global palm oil industry, which, despite being a major economic player projected to be worth $88 billion by 2022, faces criticism for environmental degradation and labor issues. Activists urge stricter government enforcement against non-compliant palm oil firms, while industry executives argue that monitoring third-party suppliers is challenging. Olam maintains that its operations in Gabon are responsible and transparent, aligning with the country's right to develop agricultural land sustainably.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Savage observes that Liverpool are currently far from the level required to contend for the Premier League title and may struggle to secure a top-four finish. This downturn is partly due to the team overachieving last season, which has led to unrealistic expectations among fans.\n\nSavage critiques manager Brendan Rodgers' transfer decisions, particularly in replacing strikers Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. The current forward optionsâMario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, and Fabio Boriniâare deemed insufficient, lacking both goal-scoring prowess and the high work-rate that characterized Liverpool's attack last season. This deficiency has resulted in a significant drop in early goals and a lack of pressing intensity, leaving the team often chasing games.\n\nDefensive frailties persist despite substantial investments in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The back line lacks leadership, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's hesitance to command his area exacerbates the issue. Set-piece effectiveness has also declined sharply, removing a crucial source of goals from the previous campaign.\n\nAhead of the clash with Chelsea, Savage proposes a lineup that includes Kolo Toure over Lovren, citing Toure's solid performance against Real Madrid. He emphasizes the need for disciplined full-backs and a dynamic midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling to challenge Chelsea's robust defense. However, Savage concedes that even with these adjustments, it's difficult to envision Liverpool defeating a Chelsea side that appears superior in all facets of the game.\n\nAddressing Steven Gerrard's situation, Savage acknowledges the psychological and physical hurdles the 34-year-old faces. Despite the infamous slip against Chelsea that marred last season and ongoing speculation about his future, Gerrard remains one of Liverpool's key players. Savage believes Gerrard's experience, skill set, and enduring fitness make him integral to the team's long-term plans. He commends Gerrard's resilience and continued contributions, underscoring his status as one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders.\n\nOverall, Savage's analysis underscores the significant challenges Liverpool face in replicating past successes and the critical decisions required to restore their competitiveness at the highest level.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Conservative MP Chris Davies of Brecon and Radnorshire condemned the decision as \"abhorrent\" and plans to fight it by launching a petition. He emphasized the barracks' significant history, its role in every conflict since the early 19th century, and its importance to a town with high unemployment and a thriving military tourism industry. While Brecon Barracks employs about 85 civilian staff and 90 military personnel, it is not believed that jobs are immediately at risk. Nearby facilities like the Sennybridge training ground and the infantry school at Dering Lines are not affected. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon stated that the reorganization would include establishing a specialist light infantry centre at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan. Additionally, Cawdor Barracks in Pembrokeshire is set to close in 2024, and a storage depot at Sennybridge will close in 2025.

Despite fishing communities around the UK having voted heavily in favor of leaving the EUâseeing Brexit as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and enhance the nation's fishing industryâthe Lords caution that these communities risk being marginalized in broader negotiations.\n\nFishing constitutes only 0.5% of the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, potentially making it a low government priority. However, the committee emphasizes the industry's importance, noting that most commercial fish stocks are shared with EU countries, the majority of UK-caught fish are exported primarily to the EU, and a significant portion of fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU states. Therefore, maintaining market access is crucial for a successful industry.\n\nThe report highlights that the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), though criticized by the UK fishing industry for its quotas and equal access principles, includes elements that should be retained post-Brexit, such as basing total allowable catches and quotas on scientific advice. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management within the UK's constituent nationsâEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nWhile acknowledging potential risks, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic. Recent increases in allowable catches for species like plaice, haddock, and prawns under the CFP are seen as positive indicators. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, expressed confidence that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch opportunities and better sustainable fisheries management, benefiting coastal communities.\n\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson reiterated the aim to secure maximum freedom for British companies to trade within the single market while viewing Brexit as an opportunity to review fisheries management. The goal is to ensure fair access to quotas, sustainable fish stocks, and a healthy marine environment as the UK navigates its future outside the EU.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A coup by indigenous Fijians in 1987 overthrew an elected, Indian-dominated coalition government, triggering adverse events such as the introductionâand subsequent withdrawalâof a constitution promoting indigenous Fijian political supremacy. In 2000, a coup led by businessman George Speight resulted in the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet, and several MPs being held hostage for several weeks. These events severely harmed Fiji's economy, particularly the tourism industry, and tarnished its international reputation.\n\nPersistent disputes over granting amnesty to those behind the 2000 coup fueled ongoing tensions, culminating in a bloodless military takeover in 2006âthe fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth due to a lack of progress toward democracy, marking only the second full suspension in the organization's history. The government agreed in 2012 to hold free elections in 2014, leading to the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Australia and New Zealand and Fiji's reinstatement in the Commonwealth after the elections.\n\nFiji's population is primarily based on the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, and is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijiansâthe descendants of indentured laborers from India.

The pound initially fell against the dollar and euro, recovered slightly in mid-afternoon trading, but fell again. The volatility index, a measure of investor uncertainty, reached levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nInvestors are concerned due to data suggesting a decreased likelihood of a Remain vote. Two recent polls showed the Leave campaign ahead, and betting firm Betfair reported the implied probability of a Remain outcome dropping to 68.5% from nearly 80% the previous week. Analysts like Charalambos Pissouros anticipate that incoming polls will cause more pronounced movements in the pound's value as the referendum approaches.\n\nHedge funds have been betting on further declines in sterling, with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed noting increased short-selling activities. Joe Rundle of ETX Capital stated that markets are on full Brexit alert, observing that sterling has shed more than 2% over two sessions.\n\nGlobal markets have also been affected. Asian stock markets saw significant drops due to concerns about the economic impact of a potential Brexit, with Japan's Nikkei index closing down 3.5% and Hong Kong's main index falling by 2.5%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.1%, with financial institutions like Lloyds Banking Group experiencing notable declines.\n\nNigel Farage, a Leave campaigner, argued that despite recent volatility, sterling is stronger since March and that the FTSE 100 remains at similar levels. He also highlighted that a weaker pound could benefit UK exporters. Supporting this point, recent official figures indicated that the UK's trade deficit narrowed in April due to a surge in exports.\n\nIn summary, the passage highlights the heightened market volatility and investor anxiety caused by the approaching Brexit referendum, reflected in currency fluctuations, stock market declines, and shifting polling data influencing market expectations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The company extended its two-step verification system to cover access to iCloud backups. Now, when users sign into their account from a new device, they must enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted mobile number or via the Find My iPhone app, in addition to their password. If the code isn't entered, access to iCloud and purchases from iTunes, iBooks, or the App Store are denied.\n\nDespite this enhancement, the two-step verification remains an opt-in feature. Security experts, like Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey, suggest that Apple should make it the default setting, citing vulnerabilities in single-step password verification. Previously, even with two-step verification enabled, attackers could use tools like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker to download complete backups of user data without needing the secondary authentication.\n\nElcomsoft's owner, Vladimir Katalov, acknowledged that Apple's changes have blocked the techniques used by his software, noting that it can no longer access device lists or backups linked to an account. He praised the immediate email notifications sent to account owners when a backup starts downloading. However, Katalov expressed concerns about the recovery key system, stating it's hard to remember and could be lost or stolen, potentially causing users to be locked out or compromising their data.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal that the company plans to \"more aggressively encourage people\" to enable two-factor authentication and use stronger passwords.

Four out of five children who ate school meals had tried foods at school that they hadn't tried at home, and half of the parents reported their children asked for these foods to be cooked at home. Popular vegetables among children included carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, while aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. The research was commissioned by England's School Food Trust after concerns that some parents thought their children were too fussy to eat school meals. Officials like Rob Rees, the Trust's chairman, noted that school meals can help increase the variety of foods in children's diets due to positive peer pressure. Carrie Longton from Mumsnet added that children may be more willing to try new foods at school to fit in with peers. School meals in England now comply with strict nutritional guidelines. Approximately 40% of primary school children in England eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools, while about 46% of children in Scotland do so.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, glaciers descending from Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains covered approximately 375 square kilometers. By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to about 275 square kilometers, marking an average loss of 26%. The research, conducted by Marie Gardent and colleagues from the University of Savoie, assessed around 600 glaciers across several massifs, including Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nUsing historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, the team verified glacier boundaries through manual inspection to account for issues like debris cover and shadowing that can affect automatic delineation methods. The retreat is not uniform across the region; southern sectors like the Belledonne Massif have seen glaciers nearly disappear, and the Ecrins Massif has experienced retreat over three times greater than that of the Mont Blanc Massif. Factors contributing to the greater losses in the south include lower elevations and different climatic conditions, such as less precipitation and cloud cover compared to the northern Alps.\n\nThe northern Alps, which receive more precipitation, have experienced less significant glacier retreat. For instance, France's largest glacier, La Mer de Glace on Mont Blanc, has seen a slight area reduction from 31.5 square kilometers in the late 1960s to just over 30 square kilometers in the late 2000s. This study mirrors findings in other parts of the Alps, including Switzerland, where accelerated glacier mass loss has also been reported. The ongoing efforts to monitor glacier health underscore the broader impacts of climate variations across the Alpine region.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Fishing regions voted heavily for Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation akin to Norway. However, the industry contributes only 0.5% to the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority for the government.\n\nThe report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared with EU states, and the majority of UK-caught fish are exported to the EU, while much of the fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU countries. Continued access to the EU market is crucial for the industry's success but may come at the cost of allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\nThe Committee suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing quotas on scientific advice and cooperating with neighboring countries. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives are optimistic. They point to recent increases in allowable catches under the CFP as a positive sign and believe that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch shares and improved sustainable fisheries management.

Born in 1946, he initially showed little academic promise and spent his youth surfing in Southern California. Drafted into the Vietnam War in 1967, his experiences as a naval hospital orderly during the Tet Offensive inspired him to pursue medicine and instilled in him a sense of urgency about life's brevity.\n\nDuring his medical training, Venter excelled in research. In the 1980s, while at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he recognized the importance of decoding genes but was frustrated by the slow, tedious processes involved. Adopting automated decoding machines and focusing on messenger RNA (instead of entire genomes), he dramatically increased the speed of gene sequencing. Despite criticism from some in the scientific community, including James Watson, Venter left the NIH in 1992 to found The Institute for Genomic Research.\n\nIn 1995, his team unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, *Haemophilus influenzae*. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics, aiming to sequence the human genome in just three yearsâa direct challenge to the publicly funded Human Genome Project's ten-year timeline. Both projects published their results in 2001. While some criticized Venter for his commercial approach and lack of open data sharing, his efforts undeniably accelerated genomic research.\n\nWith substantial financial resources, Venter established the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2006 to pursue the creation of synthetic life. After more than a decade of work, his team developed \"Synthia,\" a synthetic organism detailed in the journal *Science*. Concurrently, he embarked on the Sorcerer II expedition, collecting and sequencing oceanic microorganisms to enhance understanding of gene and protein functions.\n\nDespite controversies, Venter believes synthetic microbes could spark a new industrial revolution by reducing dependence on oil and mitigating environmental damage through carbon capture. His work continues to push boundaries in genomics and synthetic biology, driven by a conviction to not waste time and to advance scientific frontiers.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Their report, conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, highlights that fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 annual apprenticeship starts in England are at level three (equivalent to A-levels). Only 20% of employers in England offer apprenticeships, contrasted with 51% in Germany, which has one of the best vocational education systems. The report notes that England's vocational system is overly complex with 18,000 different qualifications, whereas Germany has just 330.\n\nSince 2010, over half (58%) of English apprenticeships have been below level three, and three-quarters are aimed at those over 25, many already employed. Young people face stiff competition, with 11 applicants for each apprenticeship. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, calls for a radical expansion of higher-level apprenticeshipsâup to 300,000 new starts annually, primarily at level three and above, lasting at least three years. He emphasizes that quality apprenticeships are crucial for social mobility and that the current system hinders economic competitiveness and access to skilled jobs for young people.\n\nThe Department for Education responds that it is reforming apprenticeships to improve standards, including making them more rigorous and ensuring they last a minimum of a year with increased focus on English and maths. The Association of Colleges agrees on prioritizing level three apprenticeships but argues that respected level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, should be preserved. They acknowledge the challenge in creating more apprenticeship opportunities due to the current shortage of places for 16-year-olds and emphasize the need for high-quality facilities, expert teaching, and improved career guidance.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines heavy drinking as consuming more than one drink per day for women and more than two for men over the past month; binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase is largely driven by changing social norms affecting women's drinking habits. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women rose more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates increased nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared to a 23% increase among men.\n\nIn 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers, while the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained relatively unchanged. The study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, highlighted regional variations: Madison County, Idaho, had the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, whereas Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest at 36%; Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers at 2%, and Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most at 22%.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in excessive drinking, including increased alcohol advertising expenditures (about $3.45 billion in 2011), alcohol becoming cheaper due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, weakened alcohol control policies, and the influence of affluent professionals in urban areas who may engage in hard-partying lifestyles. Young people and wealthier individuals are more likely to binge drink, and changing social norms have made it more acceptable for women to drink heavily.\n\nAlcohol-related issues have significant societal costs, with approximately 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of excessive drinking exceeding $220 billion. While more individuals are seeking treatment for alcoholism, many do not seek help unless faced with serious consequences like job loss or legal issues.\n\nThe findings are based on data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older, collected through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

They stress that caesareans should only be conducted when medically necessary due to the risks of infections, significant complications, disabilities, and even death associated with the procedure. In England, over 25% of women now give birth via caesarean, a rate that has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This rise includes an increasing number of women opting for planned caesareans due to severe anxiety about natural childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia.\n\nThe WHO advocates for an optimal caesarean rate between 10% and 15%, considering the health dangers and financial costs involved. Their stance contrasts sharply with current NHS guidelines, which allow women to choose caesareans even without medical justification. The procedure's higher costâaveraging Â£2,369 for a planned caesarean compared to Â£1,665 for a natural birthâalso diverts funds from other healthcare needs.

He appeared in numerous Al Qaeda videos, threatening attacks against Western targets, criticizing U.S. presidents, and encouraging lone-wolf actions within the United States. In 2006, he was indicted for treason and providing material support to Al Qaeda and was placed on the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists\" list.\n\nThe operation that killed Gadahn also resulted in the death of Ahmed Farouq, another American Al Qaeda operative, though neither was specifically targeted. In a related attack that killed Farouq, two hostagesâAmerican Warren Weinstein and Italian Giovanni Lo Portoâalso died. Gadahn was married to an Afghan woman and had at least one child. His final video appearance was in September 2014, where he called for the overthrow of governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This increase is linked primarily to intravenous drug users sharing needles while using the prescription painkiller Opana. In response, Governor Mike Pence approved a temporary 30-day needle exchange program on March 26. \n\nSince the program's initiation, over 5,322 clean syringes have been distributed to 86 participants, and approximately 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Health officials, including Brittany Combs of the Scott County Health Department, note that participation has increased, partly due to mobile units reaching out to at-risk individuals. Officials expect the number of HIV cases to continue rising as more people undergo testing.\n\nThe future of the needle exchange program is uncertain. Governor Pence, who generally opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing whether to extend the program beyond its April 25 end date. Concurrently, legislation proposed by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere aims to allow 23 Indiana counties with high hepatitis C ratesâa key indicator of potential HIV outbreaksâto establish their own needle exchange programs. However, some lawmakers, including Senate President Pro Tem David Long, express concerns that such programs might promote drug use.\n\nFunding remains a challenge, as federal funds cannot be used for needle exchange programs due to a ban in place since 1989. Governor Pence's executive order did not allocate state funds for the program, leaving agencies to source their own funding.

FireChat allows users to chat without internet access or mobile signals by utilizing Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) on iOS and similar Bluetooth features on Android. This technology creates local networks where each phone acts as a node, enabling messages and photos to be sent securely and anonymously to nearby users within approximately 30 feet (9 meters).\n\nThe \"Everyone\" setting in FireChat extends this capability by connecting all nodes into one network, allowing messages to relay from one node to another, reaching recipients up to about 200 feet (61 meters) away. GreenStone serves as a beacon or booster within these networks, filling gaps to extend the range and reliability of message transmission. With a range of around 20 feet (6 meters), GreenStone holds messages until another FireChat user comes within range, features a one-year battery life, and can store up to 1,000 recent messages.\n\nThis technology is particularly useful in situations where traditional networks are unavailable or overloaded, such as on planes, in underground transport, at music festivals, protests, or sporting events. Open Garden is collaborating with manufacturers to design and distribute GreenStone devices, aiming to provide resilient communication options in various environments without relying on conventional connectivity.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers from the University of Manchester, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, spent two years measuring the shapes of galaxies to construct the map, which was released at the American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570-megapixel imaging device used in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) based at the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.\n\nCovering about 0.4% of the sky, the map displays clumps of dark matter by detecting the distortion of light from distant galaxiesâa phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Since dark matter does not emit or block light, its presence is inferred from these gravitational effects. The DES aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe findings support theories that galaxies form in areas with large concentrations of dark matter due to stronger gravitational forces. The maps reveal large filaments of matter where galaxies and clusters reside, as well as cosmic voids with few galaxies. Analyzing the clumpiness of dark matter will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to cause the accelerated expansion of the universe. The project involves analyzing 130 million images of galaxies, a task that requires substantial computational resources, including some of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Manager Louis van Gaal is keen to secure Depay's transfer, having previously worked with him during the Netherlands' successful 2014 World Cup campaign, where they finished third. Depay has had a prolific season, scoring 20 goals in 26 league games, and played a key role in PSV winning their first Eredivisie title in seven years with a 4-1 victory over Heerenveen.\n\nPSV's technical director, Marcel Brands, confirmed interest from Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, and a third major European club, noting that Depay's value has increased since Tottenham Hotspur's Â£15 million bid was rejected the previous summer. Depay is known for his pace, dribbling skills, and powerful right foot, often playing on the left wing and cutting inside. He has been compared to Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, and Ed van Steijn, the scout who discovered Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United, suggests Depay might have more potential than Ronaldo had at the same age. Depay's background includes stints at VV Moordrecht and Sparta Rotterdam before joining PSV's youth academy at age 12 and making his professional debut in 2011.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Tammy Abraham was instrumental for Chelsea, scoring two first-half goalsâhis 35th and 36th of the seasonâto give his team the lead. Although Isaac Buckley-Ricketts equalized for City with a well-placed finish, Chelsea regained control, and Dominic Solanke added a late third goal to extend their advantage.\n\nThe match featured standout performances from players on both sides. For Chelsea, defenders Fikayo Tomori and Jake Clarke-Salter formed a solid partnership, effectively neutralizing City's attacks. Ola Aina was influential at right-back, frequently finding space and contributing to both defense and attack. Midfielder Charlie Colkett led by example in the center of the park, helping Chelsea win the midfield battle. Abraham's impressive display was cut short due to an injury that saw him substituted in the 67th minute.\n\nOn the Manchester City side, captain Tosin Adarabioyo was a commanding presence in defense, displaying attributes reminiscent of Yaya TourÃ©. Brandon Barker, considered City's star man, showed flashes of brilliance with his surging runs but was occasionally guilty of overcomplicating play. Aaron Nemane showcased skill on the wing, outwitting opponents but struggling to deliver the final decisive pass. Goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had uncertain moments under high balls and was unable to prevent Chelsea's goals despite some efforts.\n\nChelsea's victory gives them a significant advantage as they head back to West London, putting them in a strong position for the next leg of the competition.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research presented in his book *Sex by Numbers* indicates that the average British heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this trend to the erosion of boundaries between work and personal life, as people are frequently checking emails and remaining connected to work during home hours. Catherine Mercer from the British National Survey supports this view, stating that with more competing demands on time and the pervasive use of technology, sex often falls lower on people's list of priorities, and individuals may find it difficult to focus on their partners at bedtime due to ongoing connections with the outside world.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These dogs are now so unwanted that they're being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skin made into leather belts. Several factors contribute to this downturn:\n\n- **Anti-Corruption Crackdown**: The Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign has deterred wealthy businessmen from gifting Tibetan Mastiffs to officials as a means of influence. Luo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, noted that people no longer dare to give or accept these dogs as gifts.\n\n- **Urban Restrictions**: Recent bans on owning dogs weighing more than 50 kg in several Chinese citiesâincluding Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjinâhave significantly impacted the breed's popularity.\n\n- **Breeding Issues**: Unscrupulous breeders engaged in cross-breeding practices have led to a deterioration in the dogs' appearance and temperament. This has resulted in a surplus of poor-quality dogs that are difficult to sell.\n\n- **Urbanization**: The rapid pace of urbanization has made more people realize that Tibetan Mastiffs are not well-suited to city living.\n\nAnimal welfare workers have rescued Tibetan Mastiffs en route to slaughterhouses supplying meat for hotpot restaurants. Many of these dogs were found in cramped cages without food or water, with some already dead or suffering from broken bones. Additionally, there are reports of gangs stealing Mastiffs from the streets to sell to slaughterhouses, and breeders offloading \"imperfect\" dogs to abattoirs.\n\nThe breed's fall from grace is stark compared to its heyday starting in 2005 when Tibetan Mastiffs became status symbols. In 2014, a golden-haired one-year-old Mastiff puppy sold for Â£1.2 millionâthe highest price ever paid for a dog at the time.
