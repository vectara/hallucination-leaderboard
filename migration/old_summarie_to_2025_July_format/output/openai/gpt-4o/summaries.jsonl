The study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, revealing that boys are particularly prone to weight gain and slightly increased height after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might kill gut bacteria that help digest food, potentially increasing appetite and food availability for the body. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy due to its potential role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. The overuse of antibiotics is also linked to higher risks of eczema, digestive issues, and the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4o", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, published in Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics, which are known to fatten farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, revealing that boys are particularly prone to weight gain and slightly increased height after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might kill gut bacteria that help digest food, potentially increasing appetite and food availability for the body. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy due to its potential role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. The overuse of antibiotics is also linked to higher risks of eczema, digestive issues, and the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4o", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, published in Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics, which are known to fatten farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, revealing that boys are particularly prone to weight gain and slightly increased height after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might kill gut bacteria that help digest food, potentially increasing appetite and food availability for the body. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy due to its potential role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. The overuse of antibiotics is also linked to higher risks of eczema, digestive issues, and the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4o", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, published in Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics, which are known to fatten farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, revealing that boys are particularly prone to weight gain and slightly increased height after antibiotic use. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics might kill gut bacteria that help digest food, potentially increasing appetite and food availability for the body. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy due to its potential role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. The overuse of antibiotics is also linked to higher risks of eczema, digestive issues, and the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4o", "date_code": null, "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
