UK officials believe they poisoned Litvinenko in London in 2006, leading to his death after consuming contaminated tea. Horwell indicated the evidence points to possible Russian state participation but clarified that this does not implicate Vladimir Putin directly or suggest he ordered the murder. Litvinenko's defection to the UK and criticism of Putin may have contributed to motives. The suspects left a trail of polonium, and scientific evidence strongly supports their involvement. Despite efforts, extradition failed, and they remain in Russia. The inquiry criticized Kovtun for not testifying, and the case's prosecution for murder now appears unlikely.

Research shows Britons have reduced their average sexual frequency from five times a month in 1990 to three times now. Professor David Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the pervasive integration of technology into daily life, which blurs boundaries between work and home, making people busier and less focused on intimate time.
