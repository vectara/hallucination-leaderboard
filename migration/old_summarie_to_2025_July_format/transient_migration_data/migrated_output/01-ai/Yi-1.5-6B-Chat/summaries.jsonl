By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with children who had taken antibiotics as babies being particularly likely to be overweight. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but if they do, it may be because they kill off gut bugs that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body.

Welsh charities and organizations, including Tenovus Cancer Care, BMA Cymru, and Cardiff University's HPV research team, are urging the Welsh government to roll out the vaccination program, citing an increasing number of head and neck cancer cases, particularly affecting men and the elderly. Dr. Mererid Evans, a consultant oncologist, notes a shift in demographics towards younger individuals with families, with a majority of head and neck cancer cases affecting men and being non-smokers. HPV is responsible for 5% of the global cancer burden. A vaccination program was introduced in schools in 2008, with 85% of girls in Wales being vaccinated. The Welsh government is awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation before considering any changes to the HPV vaccination program.", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-6B-Chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study found that women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise, but are less likely to receive one. The research debunked the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggested that women avoid asking for more money. The study also found no evidence to support the notion that women are more hesitant to request a salary increase due to concerns about upsetting their boss or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. The researchers took into account various factors such as the size of the employer, industry, whether the worker is a parent, and their qualifications. The study's data was derived from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey, which is the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise and why they had or had not done so. The study concluded that there is some element of discrimination against women, but also noted differences in age, with both women and men under 40 asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate", "company": "01-ai", "model_name": "Yi-1.5-6B-Chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research has shown that the number of times Britons have sex each month has been decreasing since the rise of the internet. Professor Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, noted in his book \"Sex by Numbers\" that typical heterosexual couples now have sex three times a month, down from five times a month in 1990 and four times a month in 2000. He attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives, with people constantly checking emails and the increased busyness of life due to better technological connections eroding boundaries between home, work, and the outside world.
