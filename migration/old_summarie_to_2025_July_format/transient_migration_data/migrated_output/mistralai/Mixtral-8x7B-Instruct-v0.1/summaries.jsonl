A pilot scheme in the Cynon Valley and Neath Port Talbot now focuses on patients whose doctors cannot find any signs or symptoms of cancer. This came about a year after doctors visited Denmark to study their diagnostic systems. Health board officials noted improvements in the cancer diagnosis service in Namur, Belgium. The concern is that patients in Wales with clear symptoms are waiting too long for a diagnosis because they are not \"easily slotting into\" a specific treatment pathway. This means that doctors refer patients back and forth, taking several weeks. As a result, there is a risk of patients starting treatment too late or not being able to improve their condition. Forty doctors in the Cynon Valley believe that perhaps 40% of patients could be referred to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days. The hope is that this can happen in one day. Currently, only 35% of patients with symptoms that are \"cause for concern\" receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors therefore need to reach more of the patients who do not have obvious symptoms of cancer. A robust triage will be established at the Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another health board trial. These trials have been developed over the past 12 months after Welsh experts returned from Aarhus. Denmark initially established diagnostic centers due to concerns about cancer diagnosis standards in the country. According to Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of Cancer Network Wales, the scheme will ease the minds of patients but also speed up the process. \"If the family doctor sees a patient and is unsure but worried and feels there might be something, it will give the family doctor the opportunity to refer the patient quickly to the clinic and hope for an early diagnosis.\" Dr. Gareth Jordan, a GP in Aberdare, said the pilot scheme could make a big difference to patients\\' lives. \"It would allow us to say, \\'I have seen this man, he has lost a lot of weight... he may not be able to be sent away for specialist assessment or if they do, the assessment would not be unduly delayed.\\'\" If the Cynon Valley pilot (lasting six months) is successful, other health boards in the area will offer the same service in the following months.',", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Greenstone is a small, egg-shaped gadget that acts like a beacon or booster to help messages move around wireless mesh networks more easily. The Firechat app, developed by Open Garden, launched last year and has been downloaded over 5 million times. It uses a feature called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) in Apple's iOS 7 and a similar feature in Android to send messages and photos without a mobile or data signal, creating a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other within 30 feet (9 meters). Greenstone aims to extend the range of message transmission beyond the current 200ft (61 meters) limit.\\n\\nFirechat users can send messages securely and anonymously using screen names, and data is sent from app usernames instead of mobile numbers. Greenstone is still under development and currently works with Firechat within a range of 20ft (6 meters). It has a one-year battery life and can hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden plans to work with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone, but no specific timeframe has been provided. Greenstone could be beneficial in situations where resilient communication is needed, such as in communities, neighborhoods, hospitals, music festivals, organized protests, and football matches.\",", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
