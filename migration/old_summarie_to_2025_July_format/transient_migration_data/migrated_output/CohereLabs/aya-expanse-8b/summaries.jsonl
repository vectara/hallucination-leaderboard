Key findings include:\n\n- One in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old.\n- Children who had taken antibiotics as infants were particularly likely to be overweight.\n- Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two also increased the odds of being a fat toddler.\n- Boys seemed more prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were slightly taller.\n- The study did not prove causation but suggested antibiotics might kill beneficial gut bugs, allowing more food to be absorbed and increasing appetite.\n- Lead author Dr. Antti Saari warned of the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, as increased antibiotic use could contribute to obesity.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "aya-expanse-8b", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The landmass, rising up to 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000-1,640ft long and 100ft wide. Geologists attribute the phenomenon to a nearby landslide caused by melting ice and snow, which dropped a section of land, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Local residents reported no sounds or tremors to indicate the movement. Authorities do not expect the landmass to expand further and believe it is unrelated to the recent 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Kathmandu.
