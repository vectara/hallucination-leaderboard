However, he was cleared of the two other counts by the jury. During the trial, Sgt Chris Gaynor testified that Carpenter gave the impression that he was collecting cash for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. In his defense, Carpenter claimed that he had previously piped for the charity, but that on this occasion he was merely busking. The chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, Kenneth Derbyshire, stated that he had granted Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word \"justice,\" but denied him permission to collect funds for the charity. Carpenter confirmed in his trial that the banner was intended as a tribute to the victims, not as an attempt to deceive.

Supposedly, the queen replied, \"I never have and you don't have to have your hair done like I do.\" Fell ponies, the breed of the queen's mount, are one of the oldest equine breeds, dating back to the neolithic period in Cumbria. They were used by the carvetii, the iron age tribe who occupied the region, and later by the romans as trade goods. The romans helped develop the breed to be a relatively large animal. Originally thought to have stood at around 12hh, by the end of the roman period, the average fell was more than a hand higher. The usefulness of the fell pony as a pack animal was well-established by the 13th century and the animals played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Today, the fell pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages and the queen breeds them at her Hampton Court stud.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
