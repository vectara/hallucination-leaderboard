The study is important because it could have implications for the future of cloning. The sheep are being monitored closely and have so far shown no signs of premature aging. The results of the study will be published next week.\n\nThe passage begins with a description of Daisy the sheep being examined by a veterinary surgeon. The surgeon is looking for any signs of disease or osteoarthritis. Daisy is a clone, which means that she was created from the DNA of another sheep. This makes her identical to the original sheep, except for any mutations that may have occurred during the cloning process.\n\nThe passage then goes on to discuss the history of cloning and the concerns that have been raised about it. One concern is that cloned animals may age prematurely. This is because the cloning process involves extracting DNA from an adult animal, and it is possible that some of the \"age-memory\" of the original animal may be transferred to the clone. This could mean that the clone would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.\n\nThe passage then describes the study that is being conducted on the 13 cloned sheep. The sheep are being monitored closely and are being given regular physical examinations. They are also being given a series of tests to assess their health. The results of the study will be published next week.\n\nThe passage concludes by stating that the results of the study could have profound implications for the future of cloning. If the sheep are found to be healthy and to age normally, this would suggest that cloning is a safe and viable way to create animals. This could have a number of applications, such as creating organs for transplantation or producing livestock that are resistant to disease.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born Edward Alexander Crowley in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England. He was the son of Edward Crowley, a wealthy businessman, and Emily Bertha Crowley (née Bishop). Crowley was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and natural sciences. After graduating from Cambridge, Crowley traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. He also spent time in the United States, where he met and married Rose Edith Kelly. Crowley and Kelly had one child, a daughter named Lola Zaza. In 1898, Crowley joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an occult order founded in London in 1888. He quickly rose through the ranks of the order and became one of its most prominent members. However, Crowley's association with the Golden Dawn came to an end in 1904, when he was expelled from the order for his \"unethical\" behavior. After leaving the Golden Dawn, Crowley founded his own occult order, the A∴A∴, or Argenteum Astrum. The A∴A∴ was a secret society dedicated to the study and practice of magic. Crowley also founded the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an occult order that was based on the teachings of the Golden Dawn. The O.T.O. is best known for its use of sex magic, a practice that Crowley believed was essential for spiritual enlightenment. Crowley was a prolific writer and published numerous books on occultism, magic, and religion. He also wrote poetry, novels, and essays. Crowley's work has been controversial, and he has been accused of being a Satanist and a black magician. However, Crowley has also been praised for his contributions to the study of magic and his insights into the human condition. Crowley died in Hastings, England, on December 1, 1947.

{"article_id": 583, "summary_uid": "5dbc3d563ab025059efe67c36e3462da", "summary": "The use of tablet computers in schools is on the rise, but there is no clear evidence that they improve academic performance. However, there is some evidence that they can help to motivate pupils and increase family involvement. Tablets are also becoming increasingly popular among young people, and many take them to bed to continue social media conversations.\n\nA study by the Family, Kids and Youth research group found that 68% of primary schools and 69% of secondary schools are now using tablet computers, at least to some extent. In 9% of schools, every pupil has their own tablet device. The highest use of tablet computers is within academy schools, much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\n\nThe study's author, Dr Barbie Clarke, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. However, she says head teachers reported a positive impact, and there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged.\n\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. \"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said.\n\nA separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.\n\nThe study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.\n\nFindings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.\n\nSimon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\". The benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. \"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It discusses the challenges that people with disabilities face when they need to use the toilet, and the importance of having accessible toilets in public places. The passage also discusses the campaign to make Changing Places toilets, which are larger and more accessible than standard disabled toilets, compulsory in new buildings.\n\nThe passage begins by describing the challenges that people with disabilities face when they need to use the toilet. It says that \"for many people with severe disabilities, their families and carers, this is a reality they are faced with every time they leave the house.\" It goes on to say that \"in some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny.\"\n\nThe passage then discusses the recommendations that are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities. It says that \"campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory.\"\n\nThe passage then introduces Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, who is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory. Lorna says that \"it's like playing Russian roulette,\" and that \"knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful.\"\n\nThe passage then discusses the different features of Changing Places toilets, and says that \"there are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met.\"\n\nThe passage then introduces Alison Beevers, who describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away. She says that \"imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet.\"\n\nThe passage then discusses the campaign to make Changing Places toilets compulsory in new buildings. It says that \"architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem. \"By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment,\" she says. \"As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this.\"\n\nThe passage then discusses the challenges that businesses face when installing Changing Places toilets. It says that \"for businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans. At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m). Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations.\"\n\nThe passage then concludes by discussing the positive reaction that has been seen to the installation of Changing Places toilets. It says that \"Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too. Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: \"There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt. \"But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience. \"They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible. \"You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.\"", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth's global surface temperature.\n\nSince the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth's global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a number that is currently increasing by 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Most of the current warming trend is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over decades to millennia.\n\nThe largest human influence on climate change has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The primary source of these emissions is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, and are expected to become more severe in the future. These impacts include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, changes in agricultural yields, and loss of biodiversity.\n\nRising sea levels are one of the most visible impacts of climate change. As the Earth's atmosphere warms, the oceans absorb more heat, causing them to expand. Additionally, melting glaciers and ice sheets are adding more water to the oceans. As a result, sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate.\n\nMore extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods and storms, are also becoming more common as the Earth's climate changes. These events can cause widespread damage to infrastructure, crops and human health.\n\nClimate change is also having a significant impact on agriculture.

The company works with Fresh Start Housing, a charity that finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\".\n\nInvesting Solutions makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.\n\nBoth Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\".\n\nOperating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property.\n\nThe company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room.\n\nOne of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.\n\nMr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014. \"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"\n\nNearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\".\n\nMatt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"\n\nSamir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\".\n\nFresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study also found that living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live, but the study raises questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled.\n\nThe study, which was published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal, tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said.\n\nThey found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.\n\nThe findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime have been met with concern by some politicians and academics. Prof Lesley McAra, who led the study, said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has said it is committed to tackling poverty and inequality. A spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the government is not doing enough to address the root causes of crime. Prof Susan McVie, who co-authored the study, said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\"", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

She said that she did not want to make the pregnancy too drawn-out, as she felt that would be unrealistic.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the show's decision to compress the pregnancy timeline, there is no doubt that Demelza's labor and delivery will be a dramatic moment in the series. It will be interesting to see how the show handles this event and how it affects Demelza and Ross's relationship.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It describes three groups of hackers: the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, Cyber Berkut, and Anonymous International. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops are pro-Ukrainian hackers who have hacked into Russian government websites and leaked documents. Cyber Berkut are pro-Russian hackers who have hacked into Ukrainian government websites and spread propaganda. Anonymous International is a group of Russian hackers who have leaked documents from the Kremlin. The passage also discusses the use of hackers in cyber warfare.\n\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Troops are a group of hackers who support the Ukrainian government in the conflict with Russia. They have been accused of hacking into Russian government websites and leaking documents. The group's leader, Yevhen Dokukin, has claimed that the Ukrainian Cyber Troops have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region. Dokukin has also claimed that the Ukrainian Cyber Troops have disrupted separatist funding by targeting accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.\n\nCyber Berkut is a group of hackers who support the Russian government in the conflict with Ukraine. They have been accused of hacking into Ukrainian government websites and spreading propaganda. The group's motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.\n\nAnonymous International is a group of Russian hackers who have leaked documents from the Kremlin. The group is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.\n\nThe use of hackers in cyber warfare is a relatively new phenomenon. However, it is becoming increasingly common as countries and other actors seek to gain an advantage over their adversaries. Hackers can be used to disrupt communications, steal sensitive information, and even launch attacks on critical infrastructure. The use of hackers in cyber warfare raises a number of concerns, including the potential for escalation and the difficulty of attribution.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work.\n\nTalking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior.

His teammate Lewis Hamilton finished fifth after starting from the back of the grid. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel finished second, ahead of team-mate Kimi Räikkönen. Daniel Ricciardo finished fourth for Red Bull, ahead of Daniil Kvyat and Valtteri Bottas.\n\nThe race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Räikkönen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions.\n\nRäikkönen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Räikkönen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit.\n\nVettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: \"If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo.\" Kvyat replied: \"We didn't crash.\" Vettel responded: \"You didn't. You were lucky this time.\" Kvyat shrugged: \"I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.\"\n\nIn the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: \"You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.\"\n\nAt the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.\n\nRicciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.\n\nHamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.\n\nHe began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Räikkönen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.\n\n\"The car was pretty damaged,\" said the 31-year-old afterwards. \"I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.\"\n\nMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a \"lot of aerodynamic performance\". After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It is less sensitive to poor signal conditions than voice, and can be understood by humans without a decoding device. Morse code is often used in amateur radio, and can be sent by improvised methods in an emergency. It is one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication.\n\nMorse code was invented by Samuel F.B. Morse in the 1830s. It was originally used for telegraphy, but it has since been used for a variety of other purposes, including radio communication, navigation, and signaling.\n\nMorse code is a binary code, which means that it uses only two symbols: a dot and a dash. The length of each symbol is proportional to its frequency of occurrence in English. For example, the letter \"E\" is the most common letter in English, so it is represented by a single dot. The letter \"Z\" is the least common letter in English, so it is represented by a dash followed by three dots.\n\nMorse code can be transmitted in a variety of ways, including by telegraph, radio, and sound. It can also be sent by hand using a morse code key, or by foot using a morse code clicker.\n\nMorse code is a simple and versatile method of communication that has been used for over 150 years.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh.

The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued.

The earthworks, which are possibly 2,000 years old, are made up of ditched enclosures and are thought to have been used for ritual purposes. The team also found evidence that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems prior to the arrival of Europeans, but were instead transformed by humans into a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.\n\nThe earthworks were discovered in Acre state, which is located in the western Amazon rainforest. The team, which was led by Dr. Neil Loader of Swansea University, investigated ditched enclosures that were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest. The enclosures are up to 100 meters long and 50 meters wide, and they are thought to have been built by people who lived in the area around 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe team said the function of these mysterious sites is still little understood. They are unlikely to be villages, since archaeologists have recovered very few artefacts during excavation, and their layout does not suggest they were built for defensive reasons. Instead it is thought they were used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America, or Britain's own Stonehenge.\n\nAlthough Dr. Loader - who has analysed soil samples from the geoglyphs - said the surroundings in which they were built were very different to other ritual sites around the world. He looked at phytoliths - a type of microscopic plant fossil made of silica - to reconstruct ancient vegetation; charcoal quantities, to assess the amount of ancient forest burning; and carbon stable isotopes, to indicate the type of vegetation growing there in the past. \"The indications are that the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation. So, unlike the towering Maya pyramids of Central America, they were likely not visible above the forest canopy, and this raises questions about their purpose,\" he explained.\n\nIt had been assumed prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th Century, the Amazonian forests had been pristine ecosystems, free from human influence. But the new research indicates a wide variety of plant species spread over 6,000 years, which could only have been artificially brought together by humans.

When a group of mobsters try to take over his club, Pluto must team up with a beautiful singer (Rene Russo) and a wise-cracking robot (Jim Brown) to save his business.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only $7.1 million worldwide against a production budget of $100 million.

Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\n\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money.

The club had been in financial trouble for some time, and their expulsion was the culmination of a long-running saga.\n\nThe Bulls' fate had been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead. Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.\n\nThe Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.\n\nThe last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.\n\nHereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts\n\nFormer Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too\n\nCase adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice\n\nTommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner\n\nHereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote\n\nHereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June\n\nHereford expelled from Football Conference\n\nAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.\n\nWhen last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000. They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nAn offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street. But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option. Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.\n\nThe downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates. The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.\n\nThe expulsion of Hereford United is a sad day for football. The club has a proud history, dating back to 1892, and has produced some great players, including England internationals John Aldridge and Kevin Keegan. But the club's financial problems have been well-documented for some time, and their expulsion from the Conference was the inevitable outcome.\n\nIt is a shame that Hereford United has been forced to go out of business, but it is important to remember that the club is more than just its players and its staff. It is also the fans, who have shown great loyalty and support over the years. The fans will be the ones who suffer most from the club's demise, and it is to them that our thoughts go at this difficult time.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The S-Series was a front-wheel drive sedan that was available in three body styles: coupe, sedan, and wagon. The S-Series was well-received by critics and consumers, and it helped to establish Saturn as a credible competitor in the US market.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Saturn introduced the L-Series, a midsize sedan. The L-Series was also well-received, and it helped to further solidify Saturn's reputation for quality and value.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Saturn introduced the Vue, a compact SUV. The Vue was a success, and it helped to expand Saturn's product lineup.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Saturn introduced the Aura, a midsize sedan. The Aura was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to further cement Saturn's reputation as a quality automaker.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, General Motors announced that it would be discontinuing the Saturn brand. The decision was made due to declining sales and the need to focus on GM's core brands.\r\n\r\nSaturn was a successful brand that helped to change the way that cars were marketed and sold in the United States. The company's focus on customer service and quality helped to make it a popular choice for consumers. Saturn's legacy will continue to live on in the cars that it produced and the people who drove them.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged.

However, the boy's mother is worried that this same situation will happen to other families as the special needs school system is packed to capacity.\n\n\"The schools are being put in the position where they have a family like us who desperately require a place in the school, but they really have no capacity there because the school is already over-subscribed,\" she said.\n\nThe BBC asked the Education Authority for a response to the concerns the family has raised but its spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases. \"As we have a duty to protect the privacy rights of the child, it would be unacceptable to publicly discuss their specific and highly sensitive needs\", they said.\n\nIn relation to special school provision in general, they said the Education Authority was \"currently reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland and is endeavouring to ensure that places are available close to where the children reside\".\n\n\"This work is ongoing and is designed to assist with the placement of children with effect from 2016,\" the spokesperson added.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, have rejected the allegations.\n\nThe report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources.\n\nBut Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy\". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain.\n\nSince Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that \"the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,\" the report says.\n\nTemasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they \"fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\" The fund told the BBC: \"Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address. \"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.\"\n\nIt would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas.\n\nThe report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam \"bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,\" bringing the same practices to Africa \"that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia\". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent. \"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\" it said. \"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.\"\n\nThe allegations against Olam are serious and could have a significant impact on the company's reputation. If the allegations are proven, they could also lead to calls for sanctions against Olam and Temasek. It remains to be seen how the allegations will be resolved, but they are a reminder of the challenges facing the palm oil industry.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The pound was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4226. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.6% at â‚¬1.2605 and weakened by 1% against the Japanese yen to just over 151. Investors have been spooked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen, although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries. With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier.\n\n\"We expect incoming polls to move the pound more aggressively than before,\" said Charalambos Pissouros, senior analyst at IronFX Global. \"If new polls continue to show a tight race between the two campaigns as we approach the voting day, the outcome is likely to become even more uncertain and hence, volatility in sterling is likely to heighten further.\"\n\nBBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said hedge funds had been placing bets - short-selling - on expectations that the value of sterling will sink further. \"The bears are in town,\" he said.\n\nJoe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said the markets were now on full Brexit alert. \"Polls show it's now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity.

Last week, official figures showed that the UK trade deficit narrowed in April on the back of a jump in exports.\n\nHowever, many analysts believe that a vote to leave the EU would lead to a sharp fall in the pound, as investors would lose confidence in the UK economy. This would make imports more expensive and could lead to higher inflation. It could also make it more difficult for UK businesses to compete in international markets.\n\nThe pound's fall on Monday is a sign of the growing uncertainty about the UK's future in the EU.

This led to a debate about the dress's color, with people arguing about it on social media and in the news.\n\nThe debate over the dress's color was so intense that it even caused some people to question their own perception of reality. Some people said that they saw the dress as white and gold, but then later saw it as blue and black. Others said that they could see both colors at the same time.\n\nThe debate over the dress's color eventually died down, but it remains one of the most talked-about viral moments of recent years. The dress has been referenced in pop culture, and it has even been used in marketing campaigns. The dress is a reminder of the power of social media to spread information and to create debate.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) will debate the matter on August 16. If approved, it would be the first time 8oz gloves have been used in a boxing match at 154lbs.\n\nMcGregor has used 4oz gloves in his UFC career, which offer less cushioning and theoretically lead to punches being more punishing. Mayweather has not yet submitted a waiver to use 8oz gloves, but his team has asked the NAC about the process.\n\nThe NAC's executive director, Bob Bennett, said he has never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before. Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\n\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history.

There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\n\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier. Since sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\n\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.

SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat are also working on similar projects. However, OneWeb is the first company to launch satellites for its constellation.\n\nThe launch of OneWeb's satellites is a major milestone in the development of broadband internet access from space. If OneWeb is successful, it will provide high-speed internet access to millions of people around the world who do not currently have access.\n\nOneWeb's satellites are also expected to have a significant impact on the space debris environment. The company has committed to de-orbiting its satellites within five years of their end of life. This will help to reduce the risk of collisions between satellites and other objects in space.\n\nOverall, OneWeb's project is a major step forward in the development of broadband internet access from space. The company's satellites have the potential to provide high-speed internet access to millions of people around the world who do not currently have access.

Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds \"conflict and complexity\". The Ministry of Justice said there was \"no obligation\" to name people.\n\nThe online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice. The guidance on the form highlights that it is \"not normally necessary\" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with. But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are \"unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it\".\n\nThe older version of the form left a space for so-called \"co-respondents\" to be named where appropriate. \"The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',\" Ms Hamblin explained. \"This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse.\"\n\nIf you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015. Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. \"Unreasonable behaviour\" accounted for 46,815.\n\nMs Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery \"want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them\".\n\n\"But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,\" she said. \"Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings.\"\n\nWhen you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons:\n\n* Adultery\n* Unreasonable behaviour\n* Desertion\n* Two years' separation with consent\n* Five years' separation\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms.\n\n\"As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so.

A cap was introduced in October 2022 to limit the amount that hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services can pay agency staff.

Only senior managers are exempted.\n\nThe aim of the cap is to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.\n\nNHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.\n\nThe figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.\n\nNHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.

CAF responded by demanding that Tunisia apologize by March 31, 2015, or face disqualification from the 2017 tournament.\n\nTunisia eventually apologized to CAF and was allowed to participate in the 2017 tournament.

Morocco had asked CAF to postpone the tournament due to fears of the Ebola virus, but CAF refused. Morocco then withdrew from the tournament and was banned from participating in the 2017 tournament as well.\n\nHowever, Morocco was able to have its ban overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). CAS ruled that CAF had not followed its own rules when it banned Morocco and ordered CAF to allow Morocco to participate in the 2017 tournament. Morocco was drawn into Group F with Cape Verde, Libya, and São Tomé and Príncipe.\n\nBoth Tunisia and Morocco will be looking to make a strong showing at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.

It highlights three key factors that have driven this change: the arrival of new technologies, such as the domestic freezer and washing machine; the rise of cheaper imports; and the changing tastes and preferences of consumers.\n\nThe video also explores how the ownership of some of the UK's biggest brands has changed over time. It shows that many of these brands are now owned by foreign companies, and that this has had a significant impact on the products that are available to consumers.\n\nOverall, the video provides a fascinating insight into the changing nature of consumer goods in the UK. It is a must-watch for anyone interested in the history of consumerism or the future of the UK economy.\n\nHere are some additional details about the topics discussed in the video:\n\n* The domestic freezer: The domestic freezer was invented in the 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1950s that it became widely available to consumers. The arrival of the freezer had a major impact on the way people shopped and cooked. It allowed people to buy food in bulk and store it for longer periods of time, which led to a decline in the popularity of fresh produce.\n* Washing powder: Washing powder was first invented in the 18th century, but it wasn't until the 20th century that it became widely available to consumers. The arrival of washing powder had a major impact on the way people did laundry. It made it much easier to clean clothes, and it led to a decline in the popularity of hand-washing.\n* Cheaper imports: The UK has always been a trading nation, but the nature of trade has changed significantly over the past 50 years. In the past, the UK imported mainly raw materials and exported manufactured goods. However, in recent years, the UK has become a net importer of manufactured goods, and this has led to a decline in the number of manufacturing jobs in the country.\n* Changing tastes and preferences: The tastes and preferences of consumers have changed significantly over the past 50 years. In the past, people were more likely to buy British-made goods. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend towards buying foreign-made goods. This is partly due to the fact that foreign-made goods are often cheaper, but it is also due to the fact that consumers are now more aware of the global marketplace.\n* Ownership of brands: The ownership of many of the UK's biggest brands has changed significantly over the past 50 years. In the past, these brands were mostly owned by British companies. However, in recent years, many of these brands have been acquired by foreign companies.

The study, which looked at 4,600 workers, found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings. \"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\". \"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added. \"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\" The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\"", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

If the tumour is in a child's tummy, it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine. Where a tumour is growing in a child's chest, they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing. Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump, and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems. In cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily.\n\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. Treatment depends on the age of the child, as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread. Children can have surgery, chemotherapy, as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy.\n\nThe outlook for children with neuroblastoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. The majority of children with low-risk neuroblastoma are cured with surgery and chemotherapy. However, children with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poorer prognosis, and many will not survive the disease.\n\nThere is currently no cure for neuroblastoma, but research is ongoing to find new and better treatments.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The transplant was successful, and Star has since made a good recovery.\n\nBiliary atresia is a rare condition that affects about 1 in 16,000 babies at birth. In this condition, the bile ducts, which carry bile from the liver to the small intestine, are either blocked or absent. Bile is a fluid that helps the body digest fats. If it is not able to drain properly, it can build up in the liver and cause damage.\n\nThe most common treatment for biliary atresia is the Kasai procedure, which involves removing the blocked bile ducts and creating a new pathway for bile to drain.

The most common type of liver transplant is a partial liver transplant, in which a healthy liver is donated from a living donor. The donor's liver is then divided into two parts, and one part is transplanted into the recipient.\n\nLiver transplants are very successful, and most people who receive them go on to live long and healthy lives.

This information can help doctors decide whether or not to give patients chemotherapy. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk of cancer recurrence is as low as 5%, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy.\n\nThe majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given chemotherapy following removal of the tumor to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself.\n\nBut experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called Endopredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy.\n\nMost of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: \"I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.\"\n\nProfessor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: \"With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.\"\n\nBecca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast.\n\nShe said: \"I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy.

A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just 5% and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds.\n\n\"I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,\" she says. \"There is no treatment that places your chances at zero.

Some people agree with Goodheart's assessment, while others believe that the tomb is a fitting tribute to Lincoln. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they find the tomb to be a place of historical significance.\n\nIn addition to the criticism, the tomb is also facing the possibility of being eliminated as a result of budget cuts.

The WHO says that the procedure should only be carried out when medically necessary, as it can lead to infections and even death.\n\nThe rate of caesarean sections in England has more than doubled since the early 1990s, and now stands at just over a quarter of all births. This includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally.\n\nHowever, the WHO says that this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent, due to the dangers and costs involved. In a statement, they said: \"Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at risk of short- and long-term health problems.\"\n\nThey added that the procedure can lead to \"significant complications, disability or death\" and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients. A planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369, compared to a natural birth at £1,665.\n\nThe WHO statement sharply contradicts current NHS guidelines, which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification. The watchdog NICE issued revised recommendations in 2011 allowing women to have the operation if they were very anxious about childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia.\n\nWomen are also advised to have planned caesareans if they have had a previous complicated birth, are over 40 or have a medical condition such as asthma, diabetes or depression.\n\nBut the WHO said that doctors were carrying them out too often, and underestimating the risks. Previous research has found that as many as one in ten caesareans cause infections.\n\nThe WHO's warning comes at a time when the number of caesarean sections being performed around the world is on the rise. In 2015, an estimated 21 million caesarean sections were performed globally, up from 16 million in 2000.\n\nThe increase in caesarean sections is partly due to the fact that they are now seen as a safe and effective way to deliver a baby. However, there is also evidence that some doctors are performing caesarean sections unnecessarily, in order to avoid litigation or to meet targets set by hospitals.\n\nThe WHO's warning is a timely reminder that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically necessary. Women who are considering having a caesarean section should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Sterling told an expectant audience: \"The fans are great. It's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song. You can't get better than that.\"\n\nWhile players also turned their attention to the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley next weekend. \"It's special to play at Wembley, especially because it's my home town,\" Sterling said.

He crept up to within 10 feet of the lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground. Armed only with a camera, he managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety. Unfortunately, the clicking sound of the camera's shutter alerted the lion to Saeed's presence, who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion. Saeed said, \"I was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open. I was sat on ground few feet away, so he was treating me like his prey. I was thinking - I must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way I could think of to achieve this. The story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and I just about scrambled into my car. I was laughing at that time, but now when I think back about the incident I don't think I would be able to do it again.

The pilot, Chris Georgaklis, 85, managed to fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale after the incident and landed safely. The FAA is investigating the incident.\n\nThe most common cause of a gear-up landing is human error, when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown. Another cause is mechanical fault, when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails.\n\nIn this case, it is likely that the pilot forgot to deploy the landing gear. This is a common mistake, and it is important for pilots to be aware of the potential consequences. If a pilot does not deploy the landing gear before touchdown, the aircraft will skid along the runway on its belly. This can cause damage to the aircraft and can also be dangerous for the passengers and crew.\n\nIn the case of the aircraft that touched down in Fort Pierce, Florida, the pilot was able to fly the aircraft to Fort Lauderdale and land safely. This is a testament to the pilot's skill and experience. However, it is important to remember that gear-up landings are dangerous, and they should be avoided at all costs.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The discovery came on the same day that a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many Japanese, who view nuclear energy as too dangerous.\n\nA staff member spotted the drone on the roof of Abe's residence on Wednesday morning. Dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone, which had four propellers and was 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares, and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. Cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown. Investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle. The amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism. \"There might be terrorism attempts in the future at the Olympics and G7 summit using drones,\" Suga said. \"So we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones. The government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism.\"\n\nJapanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft, but there are no flight restrictions for most of Tokyo, including the Prime Minister's residence and local and federal government buildings. Abe was not in his office at the time. He is in Indonesia, attending the Asian-African conference.\n\nThe discovery of the drone is the latest in a series of incidents that have raised concerns about the potential for terrorism involving drones. In December 2015, a drone carrying explosives crashed outside the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington, D.C. In January 2016, a drone carrying a small explosive device crashed near the Pentagon. And in March 2016, a drone carrying a small explosive device crashed near the White House.\n\nThe use of drones for terrorist attacks is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is one that is likely to become more common in the future. Drones are relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain, and they can be used to carry a variety of weapons, including explosives, chemical agents, and biological agents. Drones can also be used to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions, which can help terrorists to plan and execute attacks.\n\nThe threat of terrorism involving drones is a serious one, and it is one that governments around the world are taking seriously. In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has developed a number of initiatives to counter the threat of drone-based terrorism. These initiatives include developing new technologies to detect and track drones, working with law enforcement to develop new procedures for responding to drone-based threats, and educating the public about the dangers of drones.\n\nThe threat of terrorism involving drones is a complex one, and there is no easy solution. However, by working together, governments and law enforcement agencies can take steps to mitigate the threat and protect the public.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

However, he has come under fire from anti-drinking campaigners who claim he is glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze.\n\nJulie Robert, a cultural studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said it was \"problematic\" that the Prime Minister, who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking, thought it acceptable to \"showcase his masculinity\" by skolling a beer.\n\n\"It sets up a culture that drinking isn't about socialising with friends, it's about how quickly and how much you can drink,\" she said.\n\nDr Robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much, or how quickly, they can drink.\n\n\"It is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part,\" she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nHowever, she said it was not just Mr Abbott's skol that was concerning, it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, opposition leader Bill Shorten quipped that he was \"just pleased that Tony Abbott's learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it\".\n\nMr Abbott was labelled \"un-Australian\" for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign.\n\nDr Robert said while drinking was a part of the Australian tradition, it was dangerous to make comments that would only glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue Aussie bloke.\n\nCritics said he should be setting an example that you don't have to drink heavily to be a \"true blue Aussie bloke\".\n\nIt appeared to take the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner, as players cheered and chanted \"skoll\" and \"Tony\".\n\nHealth Minister Sussan Ley was quick to jump to Mr Abbott's defence saying there was \"nothing wrong\" with the Prime Minister's antics.\n\n“If more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our prime minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this, I think we’d have a healthier country as a result,” Ms Ley said.\n\nDuring his night out, Mr Abbott gave a speech to the players, according to Australian Women's Weekly.\n\n\"He grabs the microphone and gives a speech, which went along the lines of: 'Well isn't this a real treat, I've been a rugby man all my life but now I finally get to hang out with some real footballers' to which of course the crowd went crazy,\" coach Carradous said.\n\n\"Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch.\"\n\nWhile Mr Abbott is not the first Australian Prime Minister to show off his skolling skills, with former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke a notable example, Dr Roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking.\n\n\"I don’t necessarily think it’s a partisan thing but I do think the climate has changed and we didn’t [used to] have the concern over binge drinking that we do now,\" she said.\n\nMr Abbott was asked to have a drink by University of Technology Sydney Bats coach Simon Carradous, and the Prime Minister happily obliged.\n\n\"He drank the entire schooner, dribbling bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch,\" a witness said.", "company": "google", "model_name": "chat-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
