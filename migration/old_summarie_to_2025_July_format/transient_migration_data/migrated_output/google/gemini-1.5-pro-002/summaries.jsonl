Because of this, the fear is that too many patients begin treatment when their cancer has developed or is incurable. Forty doctors in the Cynon Valley who believe something may be wrong will be able to refer the patient to a diagnostic centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days.
