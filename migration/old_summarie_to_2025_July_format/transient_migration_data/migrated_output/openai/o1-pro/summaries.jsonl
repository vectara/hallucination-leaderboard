A key factor is the government’s anti-corruption crackdown, which ended their use as luxury gifts to officials. Additionally, several cities have banned dogs exceeding 50 kg, making mastiffs less practical for urban owners. This collapse in demand has led to dogs being sold to slaughterhouses, where their meat and hides are used for hotpot and leather. Some are found in dire conditions, lacking food or water, and suffering injuries. Overbreeding and crossbreeding have also produced low-quality mastiffs that cannot be sold. The breed’s unsuitability for city living further contributed to their sudden and drastic decline from a once highly coveted status dog to an unwanted commodity.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-pro", "date_code": "2025-03-19", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
