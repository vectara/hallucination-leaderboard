The researchers emphasized the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The study also noted that boys were more affected by antibiotic-induced weight gain and were slightly taller than those not given antibiotics.

Their fall from grace is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign, which has reduced the practice of giving these expensive dogs as gifts to officials. Additionally, new regulations banning the ownership of dogs over 50 kg in several cities have negatively impacted the breed's popularity. The market collapse has led to many of these dogs being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in hotpots and their skin for leather products. The breed's decline is also due to cross-breeding for profit, resulting in lower quality dogs, and the realization that they are not suited for city living.
