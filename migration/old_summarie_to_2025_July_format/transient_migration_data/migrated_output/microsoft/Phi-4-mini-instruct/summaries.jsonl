The function of these sites is still not fully understood, but they are thought to have been used sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes suggests the geoglyphs were constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. The research indicates that humans artificially brought together a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, transforming their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees. The team likens this to a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products, and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Van Gaal, who previously managed Depay in the Netherlands' 2014 World Cup squad, is familiar with Depay's qualities. Depay, who scored 20 goals in 26 league games for P.S.V. this season, is a prolific winger known for his close control, dribbling, and shooting ability. Despite his talent, he is still learning the game and can sometimes make mistakes. Depay has been compared to Cristiano Ronaldo and Arjen Robben, and is seen as a potential future star.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research shows that the average heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of lines between public and private lives, with people constantly checking emails and being connected to work and the outside world, leading to less time spent with partners. He also notes that the increasing number of competing demands on people's time has caused sex to fall lower on their priority list.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "Phi-4-mini-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
