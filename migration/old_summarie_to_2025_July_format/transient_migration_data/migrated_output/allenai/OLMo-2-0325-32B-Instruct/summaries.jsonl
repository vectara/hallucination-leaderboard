The researchers suggest that antibiotics, which are used to make farm animals put on weight, may also be fattening our children. The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year olds with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Boys seemed particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics and were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but it suggested that if they do, it may be because they kill off bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. The lead author, Dr Antti Saari, warned that antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. He suggested that such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlighted the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The passage also mentions that the worldwide obesity epidemic is more pronounced for boys and that an increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The over-prescription of antibiotics is a concern, as it may lead to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This technology could make solar power viable in places like Scotland and could be used to restore power quickly to disaster-stricken areas.

This money could be used to build 80,000 to 170,000 new social homes, creating the largest social house building programme since the 1970s. The report argues that social housing would still exist in expensive areas, but there would be less of it. The government's Downing Street backs the report, stating that councils should use their social housing stock efficiently and selling high-value housing to invest in more social housing is something they should consider. The Labour party, however, criticizes the proposal, saying it would drive out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods and break up mixed communities. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey suggests using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes instead. The report states that expensive social housing accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, and about 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant each year. The government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £4.5bn after paying off the debt. Critics argue that such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, creating segregated communities.

The agency focuses on housing single homeless men over the age of 35, despite legislation allowing for private accommodation for this age group. Tenants have reported unsuitable living conditions, including lack of heating, hot water, rats, and damp.

Living in poverty also increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The research, part of the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, tracked 4,300 young people since 1998. It found that a history of trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment, or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. The study also showed that household poverty increased the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors were considered. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, but girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The findings suggest a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can inadvertently reproduce conditions that foster violence. The study also found that the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefited areas with the most chronic rates of crime, with half of the communities with the highest crime rates found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.

The earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old, are large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" that were concealed by rainforest until deforestation revealed more than 450 of them. The function of these sites is not well understood, but they are unlikely to be villages due to the lack of artifacts and their non-defensive layout. Instead, they are thought to have been used sporadically for ritual gatherings, similar to Stonehenge or Maya pyramids.\n\nDr. Neil Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs and found that they were built among taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy. This raises questions about their purpose. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems before European arrival, but rather had been influenced by humans who concentrated on economically valuable trees like palms, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products. There is evidence that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a legacy of these ancient agroforestry practices.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Archery, fencing, weightlifting, and wheelchair rugby have missed out on funding. Cycling, which was successful in Rio 2016, has had its funding cut by more than £4m. Badminton England is \"staggered\" by the decision to remove its funding, despite earning a medal in Rio. UK Sport has set a target of 51-85 Olympic medals and 115-162 Paralympic medals for Team GB in Tokyo. The total investment is £345m, which is £2m less than the amount allocated for Rio. UK Sport's Rod Carr states that the government has confirmed its commitment to Tokyo 2020. Badminton is the only sport that earned a podium place in Rio to have its funding removed. Judo, which also earned a bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. UK Sport's CEO Liz Nicholl says the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly and prioritization was necessary to protect medal potential. Sports minister Tracey Crouch supports UK Sport's approach, citing its success in previous Games. Basketball, handball, and volleyball express disappointment, stating that UK Sport seems to have no interest in team sports and has not followed through on its commitment to fund their development.

The fishing industry, which voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU, hopes to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords warn that the UK may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. The fishing industry contributes a small percentage to the UK's GDP and employs around 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority in the wider Brexit negotiations. The Lords emphasize that the industry should not be marginalized. The UK's fishing industry relies on market access to the EU, as it exports the majority of its fish to the EU and imports a significant portion of its fish from EU states. The report suggests that continued market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The Lords also recommend retaining certain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing total allowable catches on scientific advice. The UK will continue to be under international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states. There is concern that leaving the EU could lead to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.

He was criticized by the scientific community but his work sped up the process. After the human genome was published, Dr. Venter focused on creating a synthetic life form, which he and his team at the J Craig Venter Institute achieved and published in Science. Born in 1946, Dr. Venter initially pursued surfing before being drafted into the Vietnam War, which inspired him to become a doctor and instilled a sense of urgency in his work. During his medical training, he excelled in research and developed a method to sequence genes more efficiently. This led to his departure from the NIH in 1992 to establish a private research institute. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome in three years, competing with the public project. Both projects published their results in 2001. Dr. Venter's disregard for scientific conventions brought him criticism but also financial success, allowing him to pursue his interests without traditional funding. He later formed the J Craig Venter Institute and worked on creating synthetic life, which he announced as a breakthrough. He also collected marine life forms for genetic sequencing.

The report warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall Brexit deal. Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the Lords say these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations due to the small contribution of the fishing industry to the UK's GDP and employment. The UK fishing industry produces only 0.5% of GDP and employs 12,000 fishers.\n\nThe report highlights that the UK's fishing industry needs continued market access to the EU, as the majority of UK fish are exported to the EU, while a significant proportion of fish consumed in Britain is imported, often from EU states. The Lords suggest that market access may come at the cost of allowing more EU access to UK waters. The report also recommends retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as total allowable catches and quotas based on scientific advice, and continuing international cooperation with neighboring states.\n\nThe Lords are concerned that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework will fall away, potentially leading to four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these concerns, many in the fishing industry believe Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats, expecting fairer shares in catching opportunities and better fisheries management outside the EU.\n\nThe government has stated that it aims to ensure maximum freedom for British companies to trade with and operate in the single market while reviewing fisheries management to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was criticized by the scientific community but his work helped speed up the process. After the human genome project, Dr. Venter worked on creating a synthetic life form, which he named Synthia. He was born in 1946 and initially did not excel in school. During the Vietnam conflict, he was inspired to become a doctor and developed a sense of urgency. He later excelled in research and developed a method to sequence genes at unprecedented rates. His work was criticized by some, including James Watson, but he continued his research outside of public funding. In 2001, both Dr. Venter's private company and the public project published their results of the human genome. He later formed the J Craig Venter Institute to create a synthetic life form and has also collected marine life forms for genetic research. The synthetic life breakthrough was controversial, but Dr. Venter believes it could lead to an industrial revolution and help the environment.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Islamic extremist activity in Wales dates back to 1998, when it is claimed that hate preacher Abu Hamza sent a group of 10 extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons, an area used by the British military for training. In 2005, two of the 7/7 bombers were photographed white water rafting in North Wales. In 2010, three would-be terrorists from Cardiff were arrested as part of an al-Qaeda inspired gang that plotted terror attacks. Michael Adebowale, one of the men convicted of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby, is believed to have studied Arabic at the former European Institute of Human Sciences near Llanybydder, which was set up by Iraqi clerics. DC Jones emphasized the importance of community intelligence in combating terrorism, stating that it is vital for authorities to examine any intelligence that comes from the community. He confirmed that Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, and Powys have been used for radicalization training, with individuals participating in ordinary activities but having ulterior motives.", "company": "allenai", "model_name": "OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The author argues that the real issue is not hormones but the bias against women in the workplace and society. The passage cites studies and examples to illustrate the bias women face, such as the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards and the different ways male and female professors are perceived.

A total of 238 lots are being sold, including dozens of books dating back to the 17th century. Mr. Hardy expressed sadness about selling his collection but entrusted it to the auction house, hoping the new owners will enjoy the items as much as he has. He built up the haul of antiques thanks to his interest in classic literature and military history. Mr. Hardy was taught by Tolkien and C.S. Lewis at Magdalen College, Oxford, and has published two books on the history of the longbow. He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose.

He was one of the worst players on the pitch during Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday. Despite a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, his form has significantly dipped. Fabregas spoke of his happiness in London earlier this week, but his form has raised questions about his durability. He was given a four out of ten by a Spanish newspaper for his performance against Holland. Fabregas has been playing almost every minute of every match, which has led to fatigue. His role as a key man in Chelsea's title charge has declined of late. Jose Mourinho will be concerned about Fabregas's toil in the midfield during the full 90 minutes against Holland. Fabregas captained Spain but struggled to make an impact. After his £30 million transfer to Chelsea, his former club Barcelona released a statement pointing out his traditional post-Christmas slump. Despite glowing starts to each campaign, his contributions decreased as each season drew to a close. Fabregas had 15 Premier League assists by mid-January but has only one in five games since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. He was on track to break Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists in a season but now looks set to fall short. Chelsea have six opponents left who Fabregas has assisted goals against this season. Fabregas's personal accolade is important, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again, the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Fabregas's assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City was his first in five games.

Harassment ranges from insults and intimidating behavior to sex attacks or rape. Six out of ten women are afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men.

Research shows that the average heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990.
