The decline began in 2013 due to issues with chassis design, and currently, the Honda power unit is the primary problem. Historically, McLaren's partnership with Honda was highly successful, notably in 1988 when they won 15 out of 16 races with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. The team faced setbacks, including scandals and periods of decline, but also enjoyed successes with drivers like Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton. Ron Dennis, who has been instrumental in the team's rise and fall, believes that McLaren will return to winning ways, driven by the renewed Honda partnership and the ambition of Alonso to secure a third title.

A pilot scheme in the Cynon Valley and Neath is focusing on patients with cancer who do not show any clear symptoms but whose family doctors are concerned. This initiative follows a visit by doctors to Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer survival rates. The concern in Wales is that patients without clear symptoms wait too long for diagnosis because they don't fit easily into specific treatment pathways, leading to multiple referrals and tests over several weeks. As a result, many patients start treatment when their cancer has progressed or is no longer curable. The pilot involves 40 doctors in the Cynon Valley who believe something is wrong referring such patients to a diagnostic center at Royal Glamorgan Hospital within seven days. It is estimated that six patients per week will be seen and undergo various tests, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of symptomatic patients deemed \"worried well\" receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors aim to reach more asymptomatic patients earlier. Similar clinics will be established in Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another pilot by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
