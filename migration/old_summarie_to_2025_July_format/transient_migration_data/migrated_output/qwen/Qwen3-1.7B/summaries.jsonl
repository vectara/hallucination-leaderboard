These earthworks, hidden by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation, consist of over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs.\" The team suggests these sites may have been used as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids or Stonehenge, but not as villages or for defensive purposes. The research indicates the geoglyphs were constructed in taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy, and challenges the assumption that the Amazon was a pristine ecosystem before European contact. The findings suggest that humans may have transformed their environment by cultivating economically valuable trees, akin to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of forest products, with some modern forests still retaining traces of these ancient practices.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-1.7B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
