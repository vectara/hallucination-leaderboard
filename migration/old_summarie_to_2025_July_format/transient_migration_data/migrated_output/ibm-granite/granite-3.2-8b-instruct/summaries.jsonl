Fleet Street, synonymous with major newspapers for decades, was a pinnacle for journalists, with nearly every national and many provincial papers having offices within a half-mile radius. It was famous for its bars and pubs, where journalists socialized and sought stories. \n\nThe street's significance peaked when television was in its infancy and social media didn't exist, making newspapers the primary source of public information. However, its decline began in 1986 when media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, leading to a bitter union dispute. By 1988, most national newspapers had relocated due to cheaper, computerized printing technology. \n\nThe passage highlights the transformation of Fleet Street from a bustling hub of journalism to a collection of sandwich bars and other businesses. Despite its decline, the street retains historical importance. Smith and Sherriff, feeling a sense of responsibility for carrying the torch of this legacy, are now transitioning to new roles - Smith as a freelance journalist and Sherriff as he writes his memoirs.

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action as better-off children committing the same crimes. Poverty also heightens the likelihood of violence among both genders, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely as affluent girls to be involved in violent crime. \n\nThe study, tracking 4,300 young people since 1998, found that a history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of young people not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young individuals are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Poverty is identified as an exacerbating factor that increases the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered.\n\nThe research also highlights a 'destructive dynamic': poverty increases the risks of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system further exacerbates these risks, inadvertently reproducing conditions conducive to violence. Despite overall crime rates falling to a 41-year low in Scotland, the study from the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre indicates that the most chronically crime-affected areas remain among the poorest and most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates are in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, and a third in the top 20% of areas with the highest unemployment rates.\n\nThe Scottish government maintains that Scotland is becoming safer, citing low crime rates and increased police presence.

The first, in 1987, was led by indigenous Fijians and overthrew an Indian-dominated coalition, followed by the introduction and withdrawal of a constitution favoring indigenous supremacy. In 2000, businessman George Speight led another coup, holding the first ethnic Indian prime minister and his cabinet hostage for weeks. These events severely damaged Fiji's economy, particularly tourism, and its international standing. The 2000 coup's aftermath was marked by persistent divisions over amnesty, culminating in a 2006 military takeover. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth in 2009 due to lack of democratic progress, only the second such suspension in the organization's history. The suspension was lifted in 2014 after Fiji agreed to hold free elections, which it did, restoring diplomatic ties with Australia, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth.\n\nFiji's population is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, descendants of Indian laborers. The latter, once roughly equal in number to indigenous Fijians, have been reduced due to emigration following the coups. Indigenous Fijians now form a slight majority. The two groups are largely segregated, with minimal intermarriage. Other minorities include Chinese and Rotumans.\n\nEconomically, Fiji depends heavily on sugar and tourism for foreign exchange, but also has mining (gold, silver, limestone), a robust services sector, and light manufacturing.

Despite the Syriza government, led by Alexis Tsipras, preparing to implement further austerity measures as demanded by creditors, there are no significant protests in Athens. Instead, Greek resorts are experiencing a boom, with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals this year, an increase from 21 million. This surge in tourism might be due to Greece appearing safer than resorts near areas controlled by the Islamic State.\n\nThe passage questions why Greeks aren't protesting against already-announced austerity measures like VAT increases and pension cuts, and anticipated reductions in farm subsidies, privatizations, and market liberalization. It suggests that the calm could be due to the impending revelation of the extent of Tsipras' concessions to secure €86bn in new credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF in the third bailout.\n\nTsipras' shift from opposing such measures to now embracing them is attributed to Greece's near-death experience in July, which led to bank closures and economic collapse, making him adopt a 'TINA' (There Is No Alternative) stance.

In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields covering Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains spanned approximately 375 sq km. By the late 2000s, this area had shrunk to around 275 sq km, marking an average loss of about 26% over 40 years. This research, presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, was conducted by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie and her team. They assessed about 600 glaciers in various massifs, including Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc.\n\nThe study utilized map archives, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual verification to correct potential errors from automatic delineation methods, especially due to debris cover or deep shadows. The only previous French Alps glacial inventory, from four decades ago, also reported around 375 sq km of ice coverage. By 1985-86, this had decreased to about 340 sq km, showing an initial retreat. However, the pace of retreat accelerated thereafter.\n\nThe glacial retreat is not uniform across the French Alps. The southern sectors, particularly the Belledonne and Ecrins Massifs, have experienced the most significant losses.

Despite fishing contributing only half a percent to the UK's GDP and employing just 12,000 fishers, the Lords emphasize that the industry should not be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. \n\nThe EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which allows equal access to fishing grounds for all member states, has been criticized by the British fishing industry. This policy was a significant factor in mobilizing the industry to vote for Brexit, with many hoping for regained control over UK waters and a resurgence as a leading fish exporter, similar to Norway.\n\nHowever, the report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in shared waters with EU coastal states. The UK exports a large portion of its fish, primarily to the EU, and imports a significant amount, often from EU countries. Therefore, continued market access is crucial, but it may come at a cost. The UK might need to allow EU-registered boats to fish in its waters in exchange for maintaining access to the EU market with zero tariffs.\n\nThe report also suggests that elements of the CFP, such as scientifically-based quotas, should be retained post-Brexit. The UK will still be obligated to cooperate with neighboring states on fisheries management. A potential concern is the fragmentation of the current CFP framework, which treats the UK as a single entity, leading to four separate fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic about Brexit. They believe it will bring opportunities for fairer catch shares and improved, sustainable management. Recent EU agreements on new fishing quotas, which increased allowable catches for plaice, haddock, and prawns, are seen as a positive sign for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\n\nThe government, in response, has stated its intention to ensure British companies have maximum freedom to trade in the single market while using Brexit as an opportunity to review and improve fisheries management for fair access, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Heavy drinking increased by 17.2%, primarily due to rising rates among women. The study defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two for men over the past month, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase in binge drinking among women is nearly three times the rate among men, with women's binge drinking rates in Santa Clara County, California, rising by 36% between 2002 and 2012. Nationwide, women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate among men. In 2012, 18% of Americans were binge drinkers, and 8% were considered heavy drinkers. Despite these increases, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively stable.\n\nThe study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, found significant variations across the country, with Madison County, Idaho, reporting the lowest binge drinking rate (6%) and Menominee, Wisconsin, the highest (36%). Similarly, Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers (2%), while Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most (22%).\n\nExperts attribute the rise in excessive drinking to changing social norms, making it more socially acceptable for women to drink like men, increased affluence allowing for more drinking, and the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. Additionally, real-term decreases in alcohol taxes, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies are cited as contributing factors. In 2010, about 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol, and the economic cost of excessive drinking was estimated at over $220 billion annually.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In her TED talk, she embraces 'fat' as a straightforward, body-positive descriptor for herself, alongside other terms like'short' and 'wife'. Bustle argues that 'fat' doesn't inherently mean 'ugly', contrary to societal programming that often views it as the worst attribute. She highlights that size discrimination in the workplace has increased by 66% over the past three decades, and negative perceptions of larger bodies start early, with many girls aged 11-17 wishing to be thinner.\n\nHowever, Bustle finds hope in studies suggesting that exposure to body diversity fosters acceptance and preference for different body types. She uses burlesque as a platform to expose audiences to a 'fat' body in a positive, glamorous light, challenging societal norms of desirability. Quoting fellow performer Beelzebabe, Bustle asserts that burlesque's body diversity encourages rethinking narrow societal standards.\n\nBustle, who weighs 240lbs, began performing burlesque in 2012, finding it empowering and body-positive. Initially nervous about her body being seen, she now feels confident, drawing strength from her first performance. She advises others to find a 'courage reference' - a moment of bravery to recall during insecure times.\n\nThough her TED talk, posted in 2014, only recently gained traction on YouTube, it has received overwhelmingly positive feedback, with nearly 38,000 views and heartening messages.

Blanco telescope in Chile, as part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES).\n\nDark matter, which constitutes about 85% of the universe's matter, is invisible as it doesn't interact with light but exerts gravitational force. The DES team measures the shapes of galaxies to infer the presence and distribution of dark matter, a technique known as gravitational lensing. The map reveals clumps of dark matter in red and less in blue, with the Moon shown for scale.\n\nThe team analyzed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies, requiring significant computational power equivalent to running 500 desktop computers for two weeks. The map shows large filaments of matter where galaxies and galaxy clusters are located, and cosmic voids with few galaxies. This data will help test current cosmological theories, particularly the hypothesis that galaxy formation occurs in regions with high concentrations of dark matter.\n\nThe DES aims to map 12.5% of the entire sky by 2018, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy. The analysis of dark matter's clumpiness will also aid in understanding the nature of dark energy, believed to be accelerating the universe's expansion.

Van Gaal is already familiar with Depay's abilities, having selected him for his World Cup squad where Holland finished third. Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season, was also pursued by Tottenham last summer, but PSV rejected their £15 million offer. Now, with Depay's value increased, Manchester United are in a strong position to secure his signature, despite interest from Paris Saint-Germain and another major European club. \n\nDepay, known for his pace, dribbling skills, and recent goal-scoring prowess, started his career at Dutch amateur side VV Moordrecht before moving to PSV at age 12. He made his professional debut in 2011 and has since made over 100 appearances for the club. His performances have drawn comparisons to Arjen Robben, with PSV manager Phillip Cocu suggesting he could reach such heights, and even Ed van Steijn, who scouted young Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United, claiming Depay is superior at the same age.\n\nDepay's international career includes a call-up by Van Gaal in 2013 and selection for the 2014 World Cup, where he scored against Australia and Chile, earning a nomination for the 'Best Young Player' award. His impressive form and potential make him a highly sought-after talent in European football.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

His book, \"Sex by Numbers,\" reveals that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of public and private lives due to constant connectivity, leading to less \"quiet empty time.\" He suggests that the rise in solo living and increased technological connectivity have made lives busier, eroding the boundaries between home, work, and the outside world. This, in turn, reduces time spent with partners. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, supports this view, noting that with more competing demands on time, sex often falls lower on the priority list. Dealing with work emails late into the evening can also prevent couples from focusing solely on each other during intimate moments.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once commanding prices up to £1.2 million each, these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots. This shift is largely attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign, which previously saw wealthy businessmen gifting these dogs to officials to curry favor. With the crackdown, such gifting has ceased due to fear of corruption allegations.\n\nAdditionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several major cities, including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have further diminished the breed's popularity. The market collapse was highlighted when animal-welfare workers rescued 20 Tibetan Mastiffs from a slaughterhouse, finding them in poor condition, with a third already deceased.\n\nThe quality of the breed has also suffered due to profit-driven cross-breeding, leading to a surplus of poor-quality dogs that can't be sold. Urbanization in China has also made Tibetan Mastiffs less suitable for city living, contributing to their decline.
