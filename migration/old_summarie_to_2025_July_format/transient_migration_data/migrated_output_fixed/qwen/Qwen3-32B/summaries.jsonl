The research, published in Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics might contribute to childhood obesity by altering gut bacteria, potentially increasing food absorption and appetite. The study observed over 12,000 children, noting that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two, with repeated antibiotic use before age two raising the odds of being overweight. Boys appeared more prone to weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller than those who hadn't taken the drugs. The study did not prove causation but highlighted concerns about the overuse of antibiotics in infancy and its potential role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. The research also points to the need for judicious use of antibiotics, as their overuse is linked to other health issues like eczema and digestive problems, as well as the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-32B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

His public presentation as a Barcelona player will take place at Camp Nou, and he may make his competitive debut against Real Madrid on 26 October. Suarez will also be available for Uruguay's friendlies in September and October. His legal team argued that FIFA's punishment for biting Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup was too severe, and Cas agreed that the ban preventing all football activity was excessive. Despite this, FIFA and the World Players' Union, Fifpro, believe the sanctions are still disproportionate.

They had other successful periods in the 1990s with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines. However, they have faced significant challenges, including a scandal in 2007 involving the illegal use of Ferrari technical information, which led to a fine, and a public scandal in 2009 involving Lewis Hamilton.\n\nDespite these setbacks, McLaren's team principal, Ron Dennis, remains optimistic about the team's future. He believes that with improvements in the car and engine, particularly with Honda, the team can break Mercedes' dominance and return to winning ways. The return of driver Fernando Alonso in 2015 was seen as a sign of this potential revival.

Her four-year-old son, RJ Jackson, suffers from Netherton's syndrome, an extremely rare congenital skin condition affecting approximately 70 people worldwide. This condition causes his skin to appear red, scaly, and inflamed, often resembling a scalded appearance. Valerie and her husband, Reginald, must constantly apply creams and moisturizers to manage RJ's symptoms, which include pain, dryness, and sensitivity. Despite their efforts, they encounter public misunderstanding and bullying, including being denied entry to public places and being accused of mistreating their child.

Netherton's syndrome, a rare form of ichthyosis, has no cure, and while symptoms may improve with age, individuals often continue to experience red, scaly skin and related health challenges.

The controversy also led to a protest in Hyde Park and intense discussions on social media, with some users calling the ads offensive and anxiety-inducing.
