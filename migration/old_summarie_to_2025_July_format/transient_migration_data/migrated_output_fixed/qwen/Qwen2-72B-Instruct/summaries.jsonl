Finnish researchers, publishing in the journal Pediatrics, suggest that antibiotics, which are known to promote weight gain in farm animals, may have a similar effect on children, potentially contributing to the obesity epidemic. The study, which analyzed the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds alongside records of antibiotic prescriptions, revealed that by the age of two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly at risk. Repeated antibiotic use before the age of two further increased the odds of obesity. Boys appeared more susceptible to weight gain after antibiotic use and were also slightly taller. While the study did not definitively prove causation, it hypothesized that antibiotics might kill gut bacteria that would otherwise consume some of the food, thus making more food available for the body to absorb, and could also increase appetite. The lead author, Dr. Antti Saari, emphasized the potential role of early antibiotic exposure in the childhood obesity epidemic and the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy. The study adds to growing concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics and its consequences on health.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The incident occurred in the dining room of Costa's home in Red Hill, Canberra, where he allegedly stomped on Freebody's head, cut his throat, and stabbed him multiple times. Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen testified that Costa showed signs of declining mental health, likely due to dementia and alcohol abuse, which compromised his brain function and understanding of his actions during the event. Mullen's assessment is based on Costa's fluctuating mood during the incident, as evidenced by his triple 0 calls, and his confused state indicated by a trail of faeces from the crime scene to the toilet. The prosecutor, Shane Drumgold, suggested Costa may have pretended to have memory issues during interviews, but Mullen disagreed. Costa's mental state at the time of the murder is crucial to the case, as it could lead to a not guilty verdict if his instability is proven.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The report defines expensive social housing as properties worth more than the regional average, accounting for 21.8% of the UK's social housing stock. Selling these could raise up to \u00a3159bn, with London alone having over \u00a370bn worth of such properties. The think tank believes this policy would be popular, with 73% of people agreeing that council houses should not be worth more than the local average. Critics fear this could lead to the creation of segregated communities and the displacement of lower-income families. The Housing Minister supports the sell-off, stating it aligns with government reforms to reduce social housing waiting lists and increase affordable housing.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with poorer young people five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Household poverty is identified as an exacerbating factor in youth offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study also finds that extreme poverty correlates with higher chances of being both a victim and perpetrator of crime. Gender is a significant predictor of violence, with boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to those from more affluent households. The research indicates a destructive cycle where poverty increases violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system inadvertently reproduces conditions conducive to crime. The Scottish government asserts that crime rates are at a 41-year low, but the study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) shows that the fall in crime rates has not benefited areas with the highest crime rates, which are often the most deprived communities.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Analysis of soil samples suggests they were built amidst taller vegetation, unlike visible structures in other parts of the world. Prior assumptions of the Amazon as a pristine, untouched ecosystem are challenged by this discovery, as evidence points to human influence over 6,000 years, with people cultivating economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.

This follows a visit by doctors to Denmark to study their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer survival rates. The concern in Wales is that asymptomatic patients wait too long for diagnosis because they don't fit easily into any specific treatment pathway, leading to multiple referrals and tests over several weeks. The fear is that many patients start treatment when their cancer has progressed or is less treatable. Under the pilot, 40 doctors in Cwm Cymon who suspect something might refer patients to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital within seven days. The aim is to see and test about six patients a week on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors want to reach the majority of patients without such obvious symptoms sooner. A suspected clinic will be set up at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another pilot by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. The trials were developed over 12 months since specialists returned from Aarhus, Denmark, which established diagnostic centers after concerns about lagging cancer survival rates. Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of the Wales Cancer Network, says the plan will ease doctor's minds and speed up the process. Gareth Jordan, a doctor in Aberdare, says the pilot could make a significant difference to patients' lives by allowing quicker diagnosis and treatment.

Initially, the network will consist of at least 600 spacecraft, with the potential to expand to over 2,000. The goal is to provide internet access worldwide, with a particular focus on connecting schools. To achieve this scale, Airbus is adopting new assembly line methods to produce satellites more efficiently and at lower cost, aiming to manufacture three units per shift for under a million dollars each. The first assembly line has been inaugurated in Toulouse, France, with two more planned for a facility in Florida. Automation, including the use of trolley robots, and a reimagined supply chain are key to this 'revolution' in satellite production. The first 10 satellites are scheduled for launch in April next year, with the constellation aiming to have nearly 300 satellites in orbit by the end of 2020 or early 2021, and over 800 by the mid-2020s. This endeavor will require the largest rocket campaign in spaceflight history, with over 20 Soyuz vehicles booked to deploy the satellites into orbit 1,200km above Earth. OneWeb and Airbus face competition from other companies like SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat, which are also planning mega-constellations. OneWeb, registered in the UK's Channel Islands, must comply with UK Space Agency regulations, which will likely focus on debris mitigation given the potential for space junk accumulation. OneWeb has committed to de-orbiting old satellites within two years and has added hardware to improve the reliability of this process. The project's success could disrupt the satellite industry, potentially leading to Airbus manufacturing satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. However, not all satellite needs will be met by this high-volume, low-cost model, as some missions will still require bespoke treatment.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

According to Snowden's leaks, the NSA has access to vast amounts of data, including chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers, and social networking data. The NSA also reportedly has \"backdoor\" access to the servers of major technology companies, enabling them to process and store information such as private social media posts, web chats, and internet searches.

Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to focus on regulating what data companies can hold about their customers rather than government activity. The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in the US, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to access cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US.

After serving in the Vietnam War, which instilled in him a sense of urgency and a drive to become a doctor, Venter excelled in research at the US National Institute of Health. He pioneered a method to sequence genes by focusing on RNA, leading to faster gene sequencing. In 1995, he unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. Venter's most controversial move was founding Celera Genomics in 1998 to sequence the human genome in three years, competing with the public project and publishing results simultaneously in 2001. Despite criticism for his approach to data access, Venter's financial independence allowed him to pursue ambitious projects. In 2006, he established the J. Craig Venter Institute to create the first synthetic life form, Synthia, which was announced in 2010. Venter also embarked on a marine life collection project using his yacht, Sorcerer II, to sequence microbial genomes from the sea.

Initially lacking academic focus, Venter's experiences during the Vietnam War inspired him to pursue medicine and research. At the US National Institute of Health, he recognized the need for faster gene decoding methods and pioneered a technique using RNA to identify active parts of the genome, significantly accelerating the process. This led to the founding of his private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research, and later, Celera Genomics, which aimed to decode the human genetic code in three years, competing with the public project. Despite criticism for his approach to data access, Venter's work has been financially rewarding, allowing him to fund ambitious projects independently. In 2006, he established the J Craig Venter Institute to create the first synthetic life form, Synthia, which was achieved and published in Science. Venter also embarked on a marine life collection project using his yacht, Sorcerer II, to gather genetic material from ocean microbes.

This delay is due to the inclusion of protection against two new strains of influenza, A strain H3N2 and B strain B/Phuket, which were responsible for a spike in flu-related deaths in Europe and the United States. The vaccine modification was necessary because the previous vaccine did not effectively combat these strains. High-risk groups, including the very young, very old, and most Indigenous Australians, will have access to free, government-funded flu shots starting April 20. Dr. Alan Hampson, chair of the Influenza Specialist Group, advises that everyone should get the vaccine, as it also provides protection against the H1N1 strain. He emphasizes that the modified vaccine should be a good match for the circulating strains and hopes it will prevent more deaths per capita than in the Northern Hemisphere. Dr. Hampson recommends booking flu shots now, considering the stock delay, and highlights the importance of protecting high-risk groups and their families. The vaccine to be used in the next Northern Winter will be the same as the one to be used in Australia over the next few weeks.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

National Geographic magazine recently critiqued the site, describing it as having \"all the historical character of an office lobby.\" This comes at an awkward time for Illinois, known as the 'Land of Lincoln,' as the state faces a financial crisis and Gov. Bruce Rauner has proposed eliminating the state historic preservation agency that manages the tomb and other sites, instead rolling it into another department. Historian Adam Goodheart, in recounting the route of Lincoln's funeral train to Springfield, describes the tomb as \"a disappointment\" and reconstructed in \"incongruous art deco style.\" The site's hours have been reduced, and it is staffed with fewer employees due to funding cuts. On the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, visitors found the tomb's iron door locked, despite signs indicating it should be open. Supporters of the site argue that the National Geographic portrayal was unfair, and the state historic preservation agency reports that the tomb is in \"excellent physical condition\" after recent repairs and renovations costing over $2.5 million. The tomb, designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead and dedicated by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874, has undergone reconstruction and renovation to provide public access to the interior burial chamber. Despite the criticism, some visitors, like William Sparks, find the site \"absolutely gorgeous\" and impressive.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Ram and thousands of West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) are hopeful for change after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party gained power in India's only Muslim-majority state. These refugees, despite never visiting Pakistan and living in Jammu, have been denied the right to own property, vote in state elections, and have been trapped in poverty due to their refugee status. The reluctance of state governments to grant full rights to these predominantly Hindu WPRs is attributed to fears of upsetting the demographic balance in the Muslim-majority state. With around 100,000 people classified as WPRs, most living in the Jammu region, the community has been affected by a pre-independence law that restricts citizenship to those born in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir. The Bharatiya Janata Party's victory is expected to champion the cause of these refugees, offering hope for change. However, veteran activist Labha Ram Gandhi warns that the community is prepared to take action if their hopes are not realized.

The harassment encompasses a spectrum from verbal abuse to physical assaults. This pervasive issue has led to a significant proportion of women, six out of ten, feeling fearful of attack while using public transport, in contrast to three out of ten men. The consequences of this harassment include women altering their daily routines to avoid confrontation, thereby restricting their freedom and effectively excluding them from the public sphere. The findings have prompted calls for a campaign to address and reduce sexist and threatening behavior on buses and trains, emphasizing the need for women to feel safe and not threatened in public spaces. Advocates highlight the importance of educating women about the illegality and unacceptability of such harassment, as well as the need to hold aggressors accountable and engage witnesses.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
