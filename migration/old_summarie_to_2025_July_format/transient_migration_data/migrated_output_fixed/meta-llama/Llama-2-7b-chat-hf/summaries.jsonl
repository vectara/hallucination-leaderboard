The study found that while tablets are becoming increasingly common in schools, there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using these devices.

However, the study also found that some schools have adopted more intensive use of tablets, with 9% of schools having an individual tablet device for every pupil.

The Observatory also reported that fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre said rebels now completely control the prison, which holds at least 3,000 detainees in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons, and the US is concerned that the UN-backed plan is falling behind schedule. Russia has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has admitted that the process has been slowed down by security concerns.

Despite the team's current difficulties, their manager, Ron Dennis, remains optimistic about their future success, believing that they will eventually break Mercedes' hegemony in F1 and become the next team to win the title. The passage also touches on the personalities involved in the team, including Fernando Alonso, who returned to the team in 2015 despite a difficult relationship with Dennis in the past.

The report, entitled \"Putin. War\", is based on facts from Russian and foreign media and aims to accuse President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. The authors of the report claim that Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive in securing key victories for pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, and that volunteer soldiers admit to being directed by Russian generals. The report also documents evidence of Russian spending on the conflict, estimated at 53 billion roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn). The opposition plans to seek donations to extend the initial print run of 2,000 copies, but publishing and distributing the report is difficult due to fears among publishers. The passage also notes that while many Russians are aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, they may find it acceptable due to their belief that Moscow is supporting independence movements. However, the opposition accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his popularity, and admits that he was successful in doing so. The fate of earlier reports published by Nemtsov, including those on corruption in the president's entourage and the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, is also mentioned in the passage.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Bidders have until January 23 to register their interest, and viewings are set to take place in late February and March. The authority wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.

However, the number or nature of the bids received is being kept confidential due to commercial sensitivity. The Type 22 frigates were originally designed as specialist anti-submarine ships but evolved into powerful surface combatants with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine, and anti-aircraft weapons systems, making them ideal flagships on deployments with a complement of about 280 crew.

The study found that women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise, but are less likely to receive one. When comparing like-for-like male and female workers, the study found that men were 25% more likely to receive a pay rise when they asked for one. The researchers eliminated the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggests that women avoid asking for more money, and found no evidence to support the idea that women are reluctant to ask for a salary increase due to a perceived female stereotype. The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate. The researchers suggest that this could mean that negotiating behavior is changing among young women. The study's findings suggest that there may be some element of pure discrimination against women in the workplace.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The goal of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) is to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a 3D map of dark matter and dark energy. The survey is using early DES observations to study the clumpiness of dark matter and how it affects the formation of galaxies. The team has analyzed 130 million telescope images to create the map, using supercomputers to measure the shapes of galaxies with high precision. The survey will continue until 2018, covering an eighth of the sky. The study of dark matter and its clumpiness will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-2-7b-chat-hf", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
