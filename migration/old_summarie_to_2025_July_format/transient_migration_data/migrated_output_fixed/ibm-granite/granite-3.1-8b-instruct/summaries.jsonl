The function of these sites remains unclear, but they are unlikely to be villages or defensive structures. Instead, they may have been sporadically used as ritual gathering places, similar to Maya pyramids or Stonehenge. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were built in taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine before European arrival, but had been artificially influenced by humans over 6,000 years, with economically valuable trees like palms being cultivated.

A pilot program in Cwm Taf region, specifically in Cwm Cynon and Castell-nedd, focuses on patients whose family medical history indicates cancer risk but shows no symptoms or signs. This initiative was inspired by a visit to Denmark last year to observe their diagnostic systems. Health board officials noted Denmark's improved cancer detection rates. However, in Wales, patients without clear symptoms often face long diagnostic periods, as they are not \"easy\" to route through specific treatment paths. This delay can lead many patients to start treatment after their cancer has progressed or when it's incurable. \n\nApproximately 40 general practitioners in Cwm Cynon believe that some patients might benefit from referral to a diagnostic center in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Llantrisant, within seven days. The plan aims to see and provide different opinions for about seven patients weekly. Currently, only 35% of patients with \"peripheral\" symptoms in Cwm Taf region receive diagnoses. Doctors aim to reach the most patients without obvious symptoms. A similar clinic will be established in Castell-nedd Port Talbot Hospital as part of another pilot program by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board.\n\nThe diagnostic centers were developed over the past 12 months after Danish experts returned to Wales.

The report highlights that while the fishing industry contributes only half of one percent to the UK's GDP and employs around 12,000 fishers, it should not be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which allows equal access to fishing grounds for all member states, has been criticized by the industry as detrimental to Britain. Many in the fishing community see Brexit as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation.\n\nHowever, the report warns that continued market access to the EU, which buys most of the UK's fish exports, may come at a cost. This could involve allowing EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters. The report also suggests that many aspects of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit, including scientifically-based quotas and international cooperation obligations.\n\nA potential complication is that leaving the EU could result in four separate fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these concerns, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic about Brexit, believing it will bring more opportunities than threats. Recent EU agreement on new fishing quotas, which increased allowable catches for plaice, haddock, and prawns, is seen as a positive sign for the future of British fishing outside the EU. The government has stated its intention to ensure British companies have maximum freedom to trade in the single market while reviewing fisheries management for fair access and sustainability.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A Canadian study indicates that removing ovaries, a procedure known as oophorectomy, can significantly reduce the risk of death from breast cancer by more than 60%. The study analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, with 345 undergoing oophorectomy after diagnosis. The 20-year survival rate for the entire group was 77.4%. For BRCA1 carriers who had their ovaries removed within two years of diagnosis, the death risk was reduced by 73%. The protective effect of oophorectomy against breast cancer was immediate and lasted for 15 years. The study also found a 65% reduction in death from all causes associated with oophorectomy. The results suggest that oophorectomy should be considered as part of the treatment discussion for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancer.

The study, which tracked adult drinking patterns at the county level for the first time, found that heavy drinking increased by 17.2%, primarily due to rising rates among women. The CDC defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two for men over the past month, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe study indicates that women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% in Santa Clara County, California, between 2002 and 2012, compared to 23% among men. Nationwide, women's binge drinking increased more than seven times the rate among men. The reasons for this shift include changing social norms, making it more socially acceptable for women to drink like men, and the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, many of whom work in high-stress, high-party tech jobs.\n\nThe study also highlights that despite the increase in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers. The researchers note that about 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $220 billion per year.\n\nPublic health experts suggest that the increase in excessive drinking can be attributed to various factors, including the affordability of alcohol due to stagnant taxes, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The two men tied up Hassan, beat him to death, and ransacked his home, stealing \u00a33,000, his TV, and mobile phone. Granger was found guilty of manslaughter but not murder, while Jackson and Chandler were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 36 years. The judge described the attack as \"pitiless and wicked,\" emphasizing its brutal nature. Granger's defense argued that she was in love with Jackson and was manipulated into the scheme, but the judge noted her deceitfulness and loss of compassion. The case also involved two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos and conspiracy to falsely imprison.

These trousers, available in various materials like denim, cropped, printed, or striped, offer a refreshing alternative to the long-dominant skinny jeans. Louise Redknapp, a fashion influencer, endorses the wide-leg trouser as a welcome change from skinny jeans. The trend has cycled back since the 1970s, with Redknapp herself having previously worn a Stella McCartney flared jean seven years ago.\n\nDespite potential intimidation, especially for those who are shorter, the key to styling wide-leg trousers is in the choice of footwear. High heels with exposed tops of the foot can elongate the leg, making the voluminous trousers more flattering. Simple tops, such as knits, shirts, or tees, are recommended to maintain a current and cool look.\n\nDenim is identified as the easiest way to adopt this trend, with Gucci's SS15 collection featuring vintage-washed flared jeans. Other brands like Celine and Stella McCartney have also showcased dressier wide-leg pants, while Topshop offers a more affordable version called the Miller jean. Finery London provides a similar style at a lower price point.\n\nThe passage concludes by emphasizing that the wide-leg trouser trend is versatile and doesn't require good weather, making it a practical addition to any wardrobe.

Thirty-one percent of men and 75% of women have never washed their own car, with only 12% of those who do it, doing so regularly. Factors contributing to this decline include Sunday shopping and increased live football coverage, which discourage people from doing chores on weekends. The rise of hand car washes and the size of 4x4 vehicles also make self-washing less appealing. During holidays, however, an estimated 15 million cars were washed by their owners, with one in four admitting they only do it to leave the house. Cars are most frequently washed by their owners in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audi, Toyota, and BMW owners are more likely to wash their cars, while Range Rover, Peugeot, and Mercedes owners are less likely.

This has left them unable to access state-run training colleges or government jobs in Kashmir.\n\nHowever, with the recent electoral success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party in Kashmir, there is a glimmer of hope for change. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), now part of the governing coalition, is expected to advocate for the WPRs' rights. Activist Labha Ram Gandhi, representing the community, has warned that if their hopes are dashed, they are prepared to fight for their rights. Despite ongoing conflict and unrest in Kashmir, where rebels fight for independence or merger with Pakistan, the region remains one of India's more prosperous states. Yet, the estimated 18,000 WPR families continue to live in abject poverty, with their children denied opportunities due to their second-class citizen status.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.1-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several major cities, including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have further impacted the breed's popularity.\n\nThe market collapse was highlighted when animal-welfare workers rescued 20 Tibetan Mastiffs from a slaughterhouse, where they were being transported for meat hotpots and leather. Many of these dogs were found in poor condition, with some already dead and others injured. The breed's quality has also suffered due to cross-breeding for profit, resulting in a glut of poor-quality dogs.\n\nThe breed's rise to status symbol status began in 2005, but urbanization has led many to realize they are not well-suited for city living. The highest price ever paid for a dog, \u00a31.2 million, was for a Tibetan Mastiff puppy in 2013.
