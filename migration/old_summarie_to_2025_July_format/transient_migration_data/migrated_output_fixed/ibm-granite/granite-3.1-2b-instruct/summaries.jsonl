The research, conducted by Finnish scientists, analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and their antibiotic prescription records. The findings indicate that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Notably, children who were prescribed antibiotics as infants, especially those with repeated prescriptions before the age of two, showed a higher likelihood of being overweight. Boys appeared to be more susceptible to weight gain post-antibiotic treatment, and they also tended to be slightly taller. The study did not establish a direct causation, but it suggests that antibiotics might contribute to the obesity epidemic by altering the gut microbiome, potentially reducing food energy consumption and increasing appetite.

Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey proposes using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and employ unemployed builders to boost the construction industry. Critics warn that such a policy could lead to the \"dramatic erosion\" of mixed communities and the creation of segregated areas of wealth and poverty.\n\nPolicy Exchange estimates that 3.5% of the total social housing stock becomes vacant annually, with 28,500 properties available for sale each year, potentially raising \u00a35.5bn.

The conflict, initiated by a dispute between President Salva Kiir (Dinka) and former Vice-President Riek Machar (Nuer), escalated in July, targeting Equatorians as well. The violence has resulted in widespread killing, rape, and civilian targeting along ethnic lines. Nelson Ladu Thomas and Otima Amos, two refugees, share their harrowing experiences of fleeing their homes in Yei and other parts of South Sudan, highlighting the brutal realities of the conflict.\n\nUganda, a neighboring country, has been accommodating these refugees, providing them with land, tarpaulins, and support to start farming. Despite Uganda's generosity, the influx has strained its resources, particularly in supplying water to the refugees. The UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator, Nasir Abel Fernandes, emphasizes the urgent need for international pressure on South Sudanese leaders to halt the violence, describing it as a \"massacre of civilians from both sides.\"\n\nThe passage also touches on the resilience of the refugees, particularly children, who continue to attend school and engage in cultural activities, despite their traumatic experiences.

The haze is primarily caused by slash-and-burn methods employed by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Olam claims to source 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers and states it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. However, Mighty alleges that Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies,\" allowing the majority of its product to be sourced from unknown entities.\n\nOlam's CEO, Sunny Verghese, maintains that the company has a strict \"no burn-no peat-no deforestation\" policy and insists that all current suppliers meet these standards. He also asserts that the company's vetting and verification process will take several more years to complete. Temasek, as the majority stakeholder in Olam, is implicated in the allegations, with Mighty suggesting that Singapore's state fund could be indirectly linked to the haze issue due to its investment in Olam. Temasek denies these allegations, stating that they fully support no-burn policies and urge oil palm companies to do the same.\n\nThe passage also touches on the broader issues within the global palm oil industry, which is projected to be worth $88 billion by 2022. This industry is often criticized for unfair labor practices, deforestation, and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives frequently clash over environmental standards, with activists advocating for stricter enforcement and governments arguing that these firms provide essential jobs and investment to rural areas.

The report suggests that the UK's fishing sector, which contributes only 0.5% of GDP and employs 12,000 fishers, might be overlooked in broader Brexit negotiations. However, it emphasizes that the industry must not be marginalized due to its significance in coastal communities. The report acknowledges that the UK's fishing industry could benefit from regaining control over UK waters and potentially becoming a leading fish-exporting nation, similar to Norway.\n\nThe main challenge lies in the shared commercial fish stocks between the UK and other EU coastal states, with the majority of UK fish being exported to the EU and a significant portion of consumed fish in the UK being imported from EU states. The report advises that continued market access for the UK industry is crucial, which might involve concessions from EU member states in return for zero-tariff access to the EU market.\n\nThe Lords recommend retaining key elements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) post-Brexit, ensuring that total allowable catches and quotas are based on scientific advice. They also stress the need for the UK to maintain international obligations for cooperation with neighboring states. A potential concern is the possibility of four distinct fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if the UK leaves the EU.\n\nDespite these challenges, many in the fishing industry remain optimistic about Brexit, citing recent EU quota agreements as a positive development. Industry leaders believe Brexit will provide opportunities for fairer catching shares and improved sustainable fisheries management, benefiting coastal communities. The government, in response to the report, aims to secure maximum trading freedom for British companies within the single market while also reviewing fisheries management to ensure fair access to quotas, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.1-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

War', which details the Russian involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since Crimea's annexation in 2014. The report, based on media reports and evidence from Russian soldiers and volunteers, asserts that Russian troops and equipment have been crucial in securing key victories for pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. These soldiers admit to being directed by Russian generals, not separatists, and receive substantial salaries for their participation. The estimated Russian spending on the conflict is 53 billion roubles (approximately $1 billion). Despite the report's compelling evidence, its distribution faces challenges due to fear among Russian families of dead soldiers and reluctance from publishers. The opposition aims to extend the initial print run of 2,000 copies through donations, acknowledging that public interest in the facts might be limited, as some Russians may view Moscow's support as legitimate for Ukrainian independence.

This research, conducted in the late 2000s, revealed that the glacier coverage in the French Alps, encompassing the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, along with Mont Blanc, had decreased significantly since the late 1960s/early 1970s. Initially, these glaciers covered approximately 375 sq km, but by the late 2000s, this area had shrunk to about 275 sq km, representing an average loss of 26% over the past 40 years. The retreat is not evenly distributed; the southern sectors, particularly the Belledonne and Ecrins Massifs, have experienced the most substantial losses, with glaciers almost entirely disappearing in the former. In contrast, the northern Alps, including the Mont Blanc Massif, have seen less drastic changes. The team used a combination of map archives, past satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and manual inspection to verify the data, as automatic delineation methods sometimes fail to accurately detect glacier presence due to debris cover and shadows.
