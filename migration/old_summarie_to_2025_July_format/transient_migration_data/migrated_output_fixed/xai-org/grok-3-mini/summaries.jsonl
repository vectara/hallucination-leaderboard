In the late 1960s/early 1970s, ice coverage spanned about 375 sq km, but by the late 2000s, it had decreased to approximately 275 sq km, representing a 26% loss over 40 years. This research, presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, mirrors glacier retreat trends in other parts of the Alps, which span countries like Switzerland, Austria, France, and Italy.\n\nThe study assessed around 600 glaciers in massifs such as Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc, using map archives, satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and manual verification to address issues like debris cover and shadows. By 1985-86, coverage had already dropped to about 340 sq km, with acceleration in retreat noted since then.\n\nRetreat varies across regions, with the greatest losses in the southern Alps (e.g., near-total disappearance in Belledonne Massif and over three times more retreat in Ecrins than in Mont Blanc). Factors include lower elevations and less precipitation in the south, while the north, including the largest glacier La Mer de Glace (now just over 30 sq km, slightly smaller than in the 1960s/1970s), experiences less retreat due to higher elevation and more cloud cover.
