The research, conducted by Finnish scientists, involved over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and showed that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two, with a higher likelihood among those who received antibiotics early in life or repeatedly during infancy. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain and were slightly taller when exposed to antibiotics. The study suggests that antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by altering gut bacteria, which could affect food absorption and appetite, potentially playing a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the need for cautious use of antibiotics due to these potential effects.

Key findings include that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action for the same crimes as better-off children and are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Poverty increases the likelihood of violence in both genders, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls, and girls from poorer backgrounds twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to those from affluent households. The study, tracking 4,300 young people since 1998, also found that a history of police trouble strongly predicts a lack of education, employment, or training by age 18. Additionally, extreme poverty heightens the risk of being both a victim and perpetrator of crime. Despite a general decrease in crime rates in Scotland, areas with chronic crime issues, often the most deprived, have not seen benefits from this reduction.

Cyber Berkut, an anti-Western group, opposes Ukraine's military actions, accusing Kiev of genocide under U.S. influence. They have hacked Ukrainian government websites, electronic billboards, and vote-counting systems, and leaked sensitive documents, including unverified claims about the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

The outbreak, linked to needle-sharing among drug users, contrasts with the county's usual annual average of five HIV cases.
