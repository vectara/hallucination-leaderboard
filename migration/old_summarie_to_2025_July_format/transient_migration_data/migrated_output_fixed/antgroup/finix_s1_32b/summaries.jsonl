The research, published in Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics might contribute to the obesity epidemic, as seen in the increased body mass in healthy children associated with antibiotic exposure before six months or repeated use during infancy. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with children who had taken antibiotics as young babies particularly likely to be overweight. The study didn't prove causation, but it may be because antibiotics kill gut bugs that normally feed on food, freeing up more for the body and possibly increasing appetite.

The exercise involves 10 NATO warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, and uses anti-submarine warfare helicopters and underwater drones to locate the invisible enemy. The lack of UK maritime patrol aircraft is seen as a key vulnerability, with concerns that a Russian submarine could track the nuclear deterrent. The purpose of the exercise is to ensure NATO readiness, but it also underscores that some nations, including Britain, cannot do it alone, and the government will need to address this in its forthcoming defence and security review.", "company": "antgroup", "model_name": "antfinix-ir1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "live", "summary_date": "2025-08-11", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "thinking_tokens": null, "execution_mode": "api", "endpoint": "chat"}

These include over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" revealed by modern deforestation. The function of these sites is still little understood, as they are unlikely to be villages or for defensive reasons, with the possibility of being used as ritual gathering places. Dr Loader analyzed soil samples, finding that the geoglyphs were constructed among taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy, unlike the Maya pyramids. The research challenges the assumption that Amazonian forests were pristine before Europeans arrived, indicating that people transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products. There is evidence suggesting that the biodiversity in some of Acre's remaining forests may retain a legacy of these ancient agroforestry practices.", "company": "antgroup", "model_name": "antfinix-ir1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "live", "summary_date": "2025-08-11", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "thinking_tokens": null, "execution_mode": "api", "endpoint": "chat"}

The UK has been cutting armed forces, with the Army size reduced and the Royal Navy and RAF having limited warships and jet squadrons. Capability gaps exist, like no Maritime Patrol Aircraft, and the UK has fallen to sixth in global defence spending. A commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence is absent, with only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledging to meet that goal. Future governments are likely to face more cuts, especially as parties do not plan to protect defence spending like the NHS. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to replace Trident and increase the defence equipment budget, but this could hinder finding significant savings. There is no political consensus on the nuclear deterrent, with Labour, the Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Greens having different stances. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers may struggle with crewing and equipment, risking a \"hollow force\" with insufficient people despite advanced equipment.", "company": "antgroup", "model_name": "antfinix-ir1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "live", "summary_date": "2025-08-11", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "thinking_tokens": null, "execution_mode": "api", "endpoint": "chat"}

The protective effect is apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasts for 15 years, especially for women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. The study analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with mutated genes, where nearly half underwent oophorectomy after diagnosis, showing a 65 per cent reduction in death from all causes associated with the surgery.

The study, by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, found that the increases are driven by women's drinking habits as social norms change, with women's binge drinking rates rising more significantly than men's. Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, noting that despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged. Public health experts attribute the rise to cultural and economic factors, including changed social norms, the influx of wealthy professionals in cities, and weakened alcohol control policies.", "company": "antgroup", "model_name": "antfinix-ir1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "live", "summary_date": "2025-08-11", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "thinking_tokens": null, "execution_mode": "api", "endpoint": "chat"}

The couple was not alerted to the photos until many months later when the bride's sister informed them, as she did not want to ruin the wedding day. Attorney Cathy Hale, representing the couple, says they were horrified and contacted Evans, who allegedly did not apologize and told them to \"sue\" him. The couple is now suing Premiere Photo under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, claiming negligence and breach of contract. Evans has denied the allegations, stating there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption and that the couple showed no sign of mental anguish. The couple's lawyer emphasizes they want an apology at the very least, and mediation is scheduled, with a potential trial in July if an agreement is not reached.", "company": "antgroup", "model_name": "antfinix-ir1", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "live", "summary_date": "2025-08-11", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "thinking_tokens": null, "execution_mode": "api", "endpoint": "chat"}
