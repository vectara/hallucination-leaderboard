The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records of antibiotic prescriptions. They found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by the age of two, and that children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also increased the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The lead author, Dr. Antti Saari, warns that the overuse of antibiotics in infancy may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlights the importance of judicious use of antibiotics. The study also notes that previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems, and that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Munden, who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching a three-year-old girl on a bus, has gone on the run from a psychiatric unit near Hook, Hampshire. He was last seen leaving the hospital in Winchfield, and police have launched a manhunt to locate him. Munden is described as being about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and having dark hair. He may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital, and images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave have been released. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 and was sentenced last August. He was also found guilty of ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard that he had been arrested after attempting to download images of children using a public computer at Hythe library. Munden, who suffers from autism and mild learning difficulties, was made the subject of a hospital order.

Stiviano and Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling, the wife of the late Donald Sterling. Stiviano, a former companion of Sterling, was ordered by a Los Angeles judge to pay back over $2.6 million in gifts that Sterling had given her. Sterling's wife sued Stiviano, accusing her of targeting wealthy older men and using the couple's money to buy her luxury items such as a Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover, and a $1.8 million duplex. Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of him. The judge's decision sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of ill-begotten gifts. The passage also mentions that Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of him making racist remarks to Stiviano, which led to his ban from the NBA and the termination of his ownership rights in the Los Angeles Clippers franchise.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Key findings include:\n\n1. Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action for the same crime compared to their better-off peers.\n2. Living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.\n3. A history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of young people not being in education, employment, or training by age 18.\n4. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision.\n5. Household poverty exacerbates the likelihood of young people offending, even after accounting for other risk factors.\n6. Extreme poverty increases the likelihood of both being victims and perpetrators of crime.\n7. Gender is a powerful predictor of violence, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls.\n8. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to girls from more affluent households.\n9. The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government, tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998.\n10.

The agency advertised for a personal assistant with specific physical attributes, such as \"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup,\" which the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called \"appalling, unlawful, and demeaning to women.\" The EHRC's chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, stated that the agency would be contacted to clarify its hiring practices. Women's equality campaigners described the ads as \"straight out of the 1970s,\" and Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, noted that the agency's approach likely violates equality legislation. The agency's founder, Nathalie Jansen, defended the use of physical appearance in job descriptions, citing the importance of first impressions. Another job advertisement on the agency's website asked for a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a luxury car for a high-profile client, which employment lawyer James Lynas described as \"clearly unlawful.\" Lynas suggested that the use of terms like \"beautiful and attractive\" could be interpreted as discriminatory against older women, and that a male applicant could sue for sex discrimination if rejected. The agency's statement on its website acknowledged the importance of first impressions but argued that it is almost politically incorrect to request someone who is both attractive and professionally qualified. However, the EHRC emphasized that the agency should align its practices with modern business standards and eliminate sexism. Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is illegal to discriminate based on physical appearance, age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children, disability, race, or religion. The agency has clients such as MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renault Formula 1 team, and Harrods, and has hired 5,000 people worldwide, including models with tattoos and piercings.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The research, involving universities from Exeter, Reading, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bel\u00e9m, as well as Brazil's S\u00e3o Paulo and Bel\u00e9m, uncovered over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" hidden for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest. These sites are unlikely to be villages, as few artefacts have been found, and their layout does not suggest defensive purposes. Instead, they are thought to have been used sporadically as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, including phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon stable isotopes, indicates that the geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, suggesting they were not visible above the forest canopy. This challenges the assumption that Amazonian forests were pristine before European arrival. The research also reveals that humans transformed the environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.

The study found that while tablets are increasingly being used in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using these devices. The study, headed by Barbie Clarke, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools and found that many pupils use their internet-connected devices to continue social media conversations even after school hours. The study also highlighted that 9% of schools have an individual tablet device for every pupil, with the highest use found in academy schools. Among schools not currently using tablets, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. The number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000 between 2014 and 2016. Dr. Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, notes that while there is no definitive connection between tablet computers and improved academic results, head teachers reported a positive impact, particularly in motivating disengaged pupils and increasing family involvement. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson suggested that touch-screen computers are particularly useful for boys and poorer pupils in learning to read.

The project was approved by EDF's board, with contracts set to be signed on Friday. However, the UK government, under Business Secretary Greg Clark, has announced a \"careful consideration\" before backing the project, leading to EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz cancelling a trip to Hinkley Point. Critics of the plan highlight environmental concerns, potential cost escalations, and the involvement of foreign governments, particularly China, which is providing one third of the \u00a318bn cost. The government launched a further review of the project hours after EDF's board approval, causing confusion and concern among EDF executives and stakeholders. The project is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement and is seen as beneficial for both French and British industries, though it has faced financial and environmental scrutiny. The passage also mentions the project's environmental impact, including the movement of 5.6m cubic metres of earth and the use of 4,000km of electrical cabling and 230,000 tonnes of steel.

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur who played a significant role in the human genome project and the creation of a synthetic life form. Venter turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race, which earned him criticism from the scientific community. Despite this, his methods and achievements have accelerated the process of decoding the human genome. He is known for his wealth and his use of luxury items like Lear Jets and private yachts.\n\nVenter's journey began with a lack of academic focus as a young boy, but his experiences in the Vietnam War, particularly his role as an orderly in a naval field hospital, inspired him to pursue a career in medicine and to value time. During his medical training, he excelled in research and recognized the importance of decoding genes. In the 1980s, he was one of the first to use automated decoding machines, which significantly sped up the process. His breakthrough came when he focused on messenger molecules (RNA) instead of the entire DNA blueprint, allowing him to sequence genes at unprecedented rates.\n\nVenter's work on the human genome project was controversial, with some scientists, including James Watson, dismissing his results as trivial. This led him to leave the NIH in 1992 and establish The Institute for Genomic Research. In 1995, he unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. His most ambitious project came in 1998 when he announced the formation of Celera Genomics to decode the entire human genome in just three years, a goal he achieved in 2001.\n\nVenter's work on synthetic life forms began in 2006 with the formation of the J Craig Venter Institute. The institute published details of a synthetic organism called Synthia in the journal Science. Venter's approach to synthetic biology has been met with controversy, but he believes it could lead to a new industrial revolution, potentially helping to reduce oil dependency and mitigate environmental damage by capturing carbon dioxide.\n\nIn addition to his scientific achievements, Venter has also been involved in a genetic treasure hunt using his yacht, Sorcerer II, to collect and sequence microbes from the ocean, aiming to enhance understanding of gene evolution and function.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Sutton Trust, a UK-based educational charity, warns that many apprenticeships in England are of low quality and too short, and calls for a significant expansion to boost the economy and improve job prospects for young people. The Department for Education is reforming apprenticeships to \"drive up standards,\" while the Association of Colleges suggests that some existing apprenticeships are respected by industry and should be preserved.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group's report, commissioned by the Sutton Trust, reveals that fewer than 200,000 out of 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England each year are rated at level three, equivalent to A-levels. Only 20% of employers in England offer apprenticeships, compared to over 51% in Germany, which is noted for its robust vocational education system. In Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for young people, with 90% equivalent to A-levels, compared to only 61,000 in England. England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.\n\nThe report also points out that since 2010, over half of apprenticeships have been below level three, and three-quarters have been aimed at those over 25, many of whom are already in work. The competition for apprenticeships among young people is high, with 11 young people competing for each apprenticeship. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, emphasizes that the opportunities for young people who do not go to university are poor and calls for a radical expansion of apprenticeships, with up to 300,000 new starts each year, primarily at level three or higher. The report advocates for a clearer and more respected vocational system, similar to that in Germany and Switzerland, and suggests that careers advice and guidance need improvement.\n\nThe Department for Education is already reforming apprenticeships to make them more rigorous and responsive to employer needs, and has insisted that apprenticeships last at least a year, include more English and maths, and be considered a job. The report calls for a more structured and high-quality vocational education system to enhance economic competitiveness and provide better skilled jobs for young people.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The 2SV system requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted mobile phone number or via Apple's Find My iPhone app after entering their username and password on a new device. If the code is not entered, access to iCloud is denied, and users are blocked from making purchases through iTunes, iBooks, or the App Store. Users can also use a 14-character recovery key to regain access if their trusted device is lost or stolen, but this key must be kept in a safe place.\n\nApple had previously offered the 2SV system but only activated it when users manually switched it on. The recent changes make the 2SV the default option, addressing a vulnerability where hackers could still access iCloud data using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker, a tool that bypasses password protection on Apple devices. The owner of Elcomsoft, Vladimir Katalov, acknowledged that his software was likely used in the recent hacks and that Apple's new security measures effectively counteract this technique.\n\nKatalov, however, expressed concerns about the recovery key, noting its complexity and the risk of it being lost or stolen. Another security expert, Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, suggested that Apple should make 2SV the default setting and encourage users to use stronger passwords.

A DNA sample from the boy's leg bone was compared to the national police database, leading to the identification of his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained that the baby was stillborn and she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She admitted to placing the dead baby in the pond, known as Windmill Pit, in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988. The boy was originally buried without a name, but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church.

The incident occurred in 2010 in Bath, Somerset, when Kristopher Hicks, then 23, was on his way home from a night out with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by Michael Young, a former soldier.\n3. Young mistakenly believed Hicks was planning to \"do a runner\" and decided to drive him back to the taxi rank to teach him a lesson.\n4. When Hicks objected, Young continued driving for almost a mile, leading Hicks to jump from the vehicle while it was traveling at more than 20 mph.\n5. Hicks suffered devastating brain injuries, developed epilepsy, and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother.\n6. Hicks' family took Young to the High Court, where a judge ruled that Young had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger.\n7. The judge ruled that Hicks was entitled to damages, but the exact amount is yet to be decided and is expected to be around 50% of what the family had requested, estimated to be \"hundreds of thousands of pounds.\"\n8. The judge also awarded Hicks an additional \u00a3250 for unlawful imprisonment.\n9.

Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for over 20 years, was convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 1999 for his role as a \"man of honour\" in the Cosa Nostra, a Sicilian Mafia organization. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for his involvement in the Mafia, including taking bribes from builders in Palermo.\n\nIn February 2014, Rancadore lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was ordered to return to Italy to serve his sentence. However, it was revealed that his case expired last October, and his European arrest warrant is to be withdrawn. Italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed. Rancadore's solicitor, Karen Todner, confirmed that the Italian Court of Appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction on the basis that it is too old to sustain a prison sentence. She is confident that the Italian government will withdraw their application for a European arrest warrant, allowing Rancadore to be discharged from the proceedings.\n\nRancadore was first arrested on a European arrest warrant at his semi-detached London home in August 2013. Although he was never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995. During the protracted extradition proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, District Judge Howard Riddle initially decided to extradite Rancadore, but later reversed his decision due to concerns about Italian prison conditions and Rancadore's serious heart condition. The Italian authorities no longer seek Rancadore's extradition, and the case will still have to be heard by the Italian Supreme Court.\n\nThe passage also touches on the broader implications of Rancadore's case, including the costs of the extradition process and the impact on the local community. Legal experts have criticized the amount of time and money spent on Rancadore's case, with one expert suggesting that the Italian authorities should have communicated the issue of the expired sentence earlier. Despite the controversy, Rancadore's neighbors expressed relief that he will not be extradited, describing him as a quiet and normal family man.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Private jet travel is a luxury accessible only to the wealthy, and the costs associated with landing fees can be substantial, often reaching thousands of dollars per flight. The passage highlights several unexpectedly popular transport hubs for the rich and famous, such as Salzburg in Austria and Darwin in Australia, which charge high landing fees.\n\nThe private jet industry is growing, with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the US in 2013 and 705,000 in Europe. The market value of this industry is substantial, estimated at $16.7 trillion in the US and $15.8 trillion in Europe. The busiest weekends for private jet travel coincide with major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl in the US and the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nThe passage provides a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the cost for a 767-400 aircraft, which can hold up to 50 passengers. The top three most expensive airports are all in Japan: Haneda Airport in Tokyo ($6,850), Narita International Airport in Tokyo ($5,600), and Kansai International Airport in Osaka ($5,400). Other notable airports include Dublin Airport in Ireland ($4,100), Bristol Airport in the UK ($4,400), and La Guardia Airport in New York ($3,950).

After surgery, cancer cells are sent to a lab for screening, and women can be informed within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. The test, called endopredict, can accurately predict a low risk of recurrence as low as five percent, which is comparable to or better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of breast cancer patients are currently given chemotherapy after tumor removal to prevent recurrence, but this treatment is often grueling with side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. Some women find the prospect of chemotherapy more daunting than the surgery itself. Experts believe that certain women have a lower risk of cancer recurrence and may not need chemotherapy. The endopredict test can help patients make an informed decision about whether to undergo chemotherapy.

This rise is largely attributed to increased drinking among women, who are now more likely to engage in binge drinking. The study defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once a month. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level and found that in 2012, 8 percent of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study also notes that about 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $220 billion per year. Public health experts offer various cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking, including changes in social norms, the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like San Francisco and San Jose, and weakened alcohol control policies.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This style, available in various fabrics such as denim, cropped, printed, and striped, offers a more relaxed and effortless look compared to skinny jeans. The trend is seen as a welcome relief from the ubiquitous skinny jeans, which have been popular for years but are now being supplemented by the wide leg trouser for a fresh appearance.\n\nThe trend has a historical precedent, having been popular in the 1970s and making a comeback now. However, the wide leg trouser can be intimidating, especially for those with shorter statures. To make the look work, it is recommended to pair high-heeled shoes with a simple top to maintain balance and proportion. High heels help elongate the legs, which is crucial when wearing voluminous, cropped trousers. A high-waisted, longer length is also suggested to add extra leg length.\n\nFor those who prefer a more casual look, denim wide leg trousers are the easiest to achieve the trend. Gucci's spring/summer 2015 collection featured flared jeans in vintage washes, and Topshop's Miller Jean is a high street option that captures the 1970s style. For a more formal look, designers like Celine and Stella McCartney showcased dressier-style pants, perfect for evening wear. Finery London offers a similar style at a lower price point.\n\nThe passage emphasizes the importance of proportion and balance in the outfit, suggesting a simple knit, shirt, or tee to keep the look current and not overwhelming. The trend is versatile and can be worn in various weather conditions, making it a practical addition to any wardrobe. Poppy Delevingne's appearance at the AW15 Chloe show in Paris further highlights the trend's popularity.

Despite living in the region for 70 years, he and thousands like him are still regarded as second-class citizens, unable to own property or vote in state elections. The WPRs, who number around 100,000, are primarily from Punjab and have been living in poverty for generations due to their refugee status. The reason for their continued status as refugees is tied to a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to those born in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir or to descendants of those born there. This has led to a demographic imbalance in the state, which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution. The WPRs have been denied residential rights, including the right to buy land, vote in state polls, or work in the state government, due to fears of upsetting this balance. However, there is hope for change as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won a share of power in Kashmir and is expected to champion the cause of the WPRs.

Today, she has regained her body image and confidence, even making it to the semi-finals of Miss Teen GB, a competition that aims to promote positive and confidence-building experiences for young girls, away from the size zero stereotype.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The club is confident that Sterling will stay, and the new kit, featuring the message \"Hold Nothing Back,\" was presented to fans with the players emphasizing the importance of the fans' support.

This map, created by researchers from the University of Manchester, is the first in a series of maps that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one-eighth of the night sky. The map covers 0.4% of the sky and is part of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), a five-year project led by Fermilab in the US. The survey uses the 13ft Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, equipped with the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device. The map was released at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe map was created by measuring the shapes of galaxies, which are distorted by the gravitational pull of dark matter. The red areas on the map indicate regions with more dark matter, while blue areas show regions with less dark matter. The moon is shown for scale at the top left. The goal of the DES is to map 12.5% of the entire sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter and dark energy. The map covers about 150 times the area of the full moon, which is about 0.4% of the whole sky. The survey has just completed its second year and will continue until 2018, mapping dark matter across one-eighth of the sky.\n\nThe map is significant because it allows astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe and to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter. The survey uses a technique called gravitational lensing to study the effects of dark matter, which is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light. Understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of dark energy, which is the ultimate goal of the survey.", "company": "internlm", "model_name": "internlm3-8b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
