This decision has sparked criticism on social media, though transition spokesman Jason Miller says the Trumps are excited about their new role. There are only two other First Ladies in history who have not lived in the White House: Martha Washington and Anna Harrison. However, some support Mrs. Trump's decision, stating that it is responsible parenting. William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian, said that it is not unusual for children to stay back to finish school. In the past, First Ladies such as Frances Folsom Cleveland only lived in the White House during social season. The role of the First Lady is ceremonial, but more recently they have sought out causes to support and promote. Melania Trump is interested in tackling cyber-bullying.

Fishing regions voted heavily to leave the EU, as the EU's Common Fisheries Policy has been characterized as a disaster for Britain. Brexit offers the chance for the UK to regain control over UK waters; however, the industry might be a low priority for the government, as it only produces a half of one percent of GDP. Most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared between the UK and other EU coastal states, and the vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU. The report says a successful industry needs continued market access, but that access may come at a price, as EU member states may demand more access to UK waters. The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit. If Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework will fall away, raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Brown does not want to be out for an extended period and will not rush his return. George North has been advised by medics to not play again this season after suffering four concussions. Brown was knocked out cold in England's game against Italy in February. Brown pulled out of the Ireland game due to concussion symptoms and credits world rugby online modules for helping him realize he was not ready to play.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet. A typical heterosexual couple was now having sex three times a month, compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Professor David Spiegelhalter says people are checking their emails all the time, and a more realistic explanation is that as we've become better connected technologically, our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work, and the outside world, squeezing out time we would have spent with our other halves. Catherine Mercer says that with an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Animal welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs being transported to a slaughterhouse, where they would be used for hotpot meat and leather belts.
