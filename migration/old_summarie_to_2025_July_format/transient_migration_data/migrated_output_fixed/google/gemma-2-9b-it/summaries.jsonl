' it 's that trust factor . you have to gain that trust , and i think we 're slowly starting to do that , ' combs said . but the future of the scott county program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear . the scott county outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller opana , health officials have said . pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy . senate president pro tem david long said on thursday that the emergency exchange for scott county was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long-term . nor was he sure whether the senate would support legislation sponsored by house public health committee chairman ed clere , r-new albany , that would allow the 23 indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis c to establish their own needle-exchange programs . the centers for disease control and prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis c are also infected with hiv . health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential hiv outbreak . the house approved the bill on april 7 in a 54-39 vote , and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on monday in a house-senate conference committee , which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the legislature 's april 29 adjournment deadline . long said pence is n't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it . ' at the same time , you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in , so we 're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us , ' long said . medical waste containers stored in preparation for scott county residents that are looking to exchange used needles . the needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by gov . mike pence in an attempt to curb the state 's largest-ever hiv outbreak . clere said he appreciates pence 's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that ' it does n't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak . it 's just not enough . ' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable . but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . ' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said . money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options . since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs . pence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program . ' they asked the state agencies to find their own money . how sustainable is that ? ' said dr. beth meyerson , co-director of the rural center for aids/std prevention at indiana university . ' there 's no evidence that the pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all . '\nmodel\nThis passage discusses Indiana's response to a large HIV outbreak in Scott County, which is linked to intravenous drug use and the painkiller Opana.  \n\nGovernor Pence approved a 30-day needle exchange program as a temporary measure.  There are concerns about extending the program beyond April 25th due to the cost and the belief that needle exchanges encourage drug use.  \n\nState Senator David Long supports the emergency program but questions its long-term effectiveness.
