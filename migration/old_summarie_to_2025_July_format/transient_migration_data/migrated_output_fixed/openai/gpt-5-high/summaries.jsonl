Gender was a powerful predictor, with boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violence, and poorer girls twice as likely as more affluent girls to be involved in violent crime. Report author Lesley McAra warned that poverty heightens violence risk and contact with the juvenile justice system can exacerbate it, reproducing conditions for violence. A related AQMeN study showed crime reductions have not benefitted the most deprived areas, where crime remains concentrated: half of the highest\u2011crime communities are also in the top 20% for chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% for unemployment, raising questions about whether inequality is being tackled.
