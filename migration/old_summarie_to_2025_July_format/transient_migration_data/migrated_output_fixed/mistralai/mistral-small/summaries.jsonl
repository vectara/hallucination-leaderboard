The researchers suggest that antibiotics, which are used to promote weight gain in farm animals, may similarly contribute to childhood obesity in humans. The study, published in *Pediatrics*, analyzed the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who received antibiotics as infants, especially those with repeated prescriptions, were at higher risk of being overweight, with boys particularly affected. While the study did not prove causation, it proposed that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria, leading to increased food absorption and appetite.\n\nLead author Dr. Antti Saari warned that early antibiotic exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, emphasizing the need for judicious antibiotic use. The findings align with concerns about overprescription of antibiotics, which may also contribute to antibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs. Previous research has linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive issues.

Once home to nearly every national newspaper, the street has seen a gradual exodus of media outlets since the 1980s, with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s move to Wapping in 1986 accelerating the decline.\n\n- **Historical Significance**: Fleet Street was the birthplace of the first British daily newspaper, the *Daily Courant* (1702), and at its peak, it was the pinnacle of a journalist\u2019s career. It was known for its lively atmosphere, filled with pubs, typewriters, and a heavy drinking culture.\n\n- **Personal Accounts**: Reporters Darryl Smith (25 years on Fleet Street) and Gavin Sherriff (32 years) reflect on the street\u2019s heyday, describing its chaotic newsrooms, printing presses, and social life. They also note its transformation into a commercial area with sandwich bars and restaurants.\n\n- **Cultural Impact**: Former editor Robin Esser highlights Fleet Street\u2019s importance in the pre-digital era, when newspapers were the primary source of public information. Liz Hodgkinson, a former journalist, recalls the gender dynamics and heavy drinking culture of the 1970s and 80s.\n\n- **Final Chapter**: With the *Sunday Post*\u2019s departure, Fleet Street\u2019s journalistic legacy has ended, though its buildings remain a symbol of its storied past. Smith and Sherriff reflect on their roles in its final days, with Smith becoming a freelancer and Sherriff writing memoirs.\n\nThe passage captures the nostalgia, decline, and historical weight of Fleet Street as a once-dominant force in British media.", "company": "mistralai", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The exercise involves 10 NATO warships, including the USS Vicksburg and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Portland, hunting a German U-boat (U33) simulating a Russian threat.\n\n2. **Russian Submarine Threat**: Russia has expanded its submarine fleet (around 60 submarines) and is investing heavily in advanced, stealthy submarines. These submarines are described as highly skilled and technologically superior, capable of remaining undetected for long periods.\n\n3. **UK\u2019s Defence Gaps**: The UK lacks its own maritime patrol aircraft (previously provided by the Nimrod), forcing it to rely on NATO allies (e.g., France) for surveillance. This vulnerability allows Russian submarines to potentially track UK nuclear deterrents without detection.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements**: The exercise includes the use of underwater drones (unmanned vehicles) to aid in submarine detection, highlighting their cost-effectiveness and reduced risk to personnel.\n\n5. **NATO Preparedness**: The exercise underscores NATO\u2019s need to strengthen anti-submarine capabilities, particularly for nations like the UK, which cannot operate independently in this domain.

Olam denies the claims, asserting a strict \"no burn, no peat, no deforestation\" policy.\n\n2. **Haze and Environmental Impact**: The haze affecting Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia is linked to slash-and-burn farming in Indonesia, particularly for palm oil, pulp, and paper plantations. Mighty alleges Olam sources palm oil from rogue suppliers, creating a \"secretive market\" for unsustainable practices.\n\n3. **Olam\u2019s Response**: Olam claims it buys 99% of its palm oil from third-party suppliers and has a rigorous sourcing policy. It released the names of 14 suppliers after pressure but admits the vetting process will take years. Olam insists non-compliant producers will be removed from its supply chain.\n\n4. **Temasek\u2019s Stance**: Temasek, Singapore\u2019s state-owned investment firm, denies involvement, stating it does not direct Olam\u2019s operations and supports no-burn policies. However, Mighty links Temasek\u2019s investment in Olam to Singapore\u2019s haze problem.\n\n5. **Global Palm Oil Industry Issues**: The industry faces criticism for deforestation, illegal labor practices, and environmental harm. NGOs and executives clash over accountability, with activists demanding stricter enforcement and executives arguing that policing suppliers is difficult.\n\n6. **Gabon Concerns**: Mighty accuses Olam of bulldozing rainforests in Gabon for palm oil plantations, replicating destructive practices from Southeast Asia.

After publishing the human genome, he focused on creating synthetic life, culminating in the organism *Synthia*, published in *Science*.\n\nBorn in 1946, Venter initially pursued surfing before being drafted into the Vietnam War, where he worked as a naval orderly. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and instilled a sense of urgency in his work. He later excelled in research, particularly in molecular biology, and pioneered faster gene sequencing by focusing on RNA rather than full DNA. His breakthroughs, including sequencing *Haemophilus influenzae* and founding Celera Genomics to race against the public Human Genome Project, challenged scientific norms but advanced the field.\n\nVenter also led oceanic expeditions to collect microbial genomes and founded the J. Craig Venter Institute to pursue synthetic biology. His synthetic life breakthrough, though controversial, was seen as potentially revolutionary for industry and environmental sustainability.

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, revolutionized human genomics by turning the mapping of the human genome into a competitive race, which drew criticism from the scientific community. Despite his controversial methods, his work significantly accelerated genomic research. After publishing the human genome, he shifted focus to creating synthetic life, culminating in the development of *Synthia*, a synthetic organism, published in *Science*.\n\nBorn in 1946, Venter initially pursued surfing before being drafted into the Vietnam War, where his experiences inspired him to become a doctor and develop a strong sense of urgency. He later excelled in molecular biology research, pioneering faster gene-sequencing techniques by focusing on RNA rather than full DNA. His breakthroughs, including sequencing the first complete genome of a free-living organism (*Haemophilus influenzae*), led to conflicts with traditional scientists like James Watson.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics to privately sequence the human genome, competing with a public project. Both efforts published results in 2001, though Venter\u2019s methods were criticized. His financial success allowed him to fund his own research, leading to the creation of the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2006. Beyond synthetic life, he also conducted oceanic genetic research aboard his yacht, *Sorcerer II*, studying marine microbes.\n\nVenter\u2019s synthetic life breakthrough was controversial but could potentially lead to industrial and environmental advancements, such as reducing reliance on oil and capturing carbon dioxide.
