This brought criticism from the scientific community, though his work advanced the field of genomics. After publishing the human genome, Venter focused on creating synthetic life. His team created Synthia, the first synthetic organism, after over a decade of work. Earlier in his career, Venter realized he could speed up gene sequencing by focusing on RNA instead of full DNA. This allowed him to rapidly generate gene sequences, though some criticized his methods. Venter founded private research institutes after leaving government-funded positions, allowing him to pursue projects with his own resources. His teams were the first to sequence a full organism genome and later the human genome. Venter has also collected ocean microbes to understand microbial evolution and functions. His synthetic biology work aims to create microbes that can produce fuels and chemicals, reducing environmental damage.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-2.0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
