The researchers suggest that antibiotics may be contributing to the obesity epidemic, similar to how they are used to make farm animals put on weight.

Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raising the odds of being a fat toddler. The study did not prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain, but suggested that they may do so by killing gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite.

He mentions that Liverpool is far from the level required for a title challenge and may have to settle for securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League. Savage criticizes Brendan Rodgers' transfer market decisions, particularly in not buying the right strikers to fit his system. He highlights the lack of intensity, work rate, and runners from midfield to support the striker, as well as a drop in set-piece effectiveness. The defense is also seen as a weak link, lacking a leader and with Simon Mignolet not commanding his box enough. Savage suggests that Liverpool will need a significant improvement to compete against Chelsea, who are currently on a different level compared to the rest of the Premier League.

The increases in heavy drinking and binge drinking were driven largely by women's drinking habits, with social norms changing.

The passage also highlights the poor treatment of these dogs, with some being stolen by gangs and others being sold due to cross-breeding by unscrupulous breeders.
