The study suggests that antibiotics may be contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic by killing off beneficial gut bacteria, leading to increased appetite and weight gain.

The researchers analyzed soil samples and found that the geoglyphs were constructed amidst taller vegetation, making it unclear why they were built. The study also suggests that humans had a significant impact on the Amazonian forests 6,000 years ago, transforming the environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees.

The study defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. The researchers found that the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. The study also found that the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time, despite the increases in heavy drinking. The researchers attribute the increase in binge drinking to changing social norms, economic factors, and cultural explanations.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3-8B-chat-hf", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He suggests that the constant connectivity and busyness brought about by technology have eroded the boundaries between work, home, and personal life, leaving less time for intimate relationships. The frequency of sex among couples has decreased from five times a month in 1990 to three times a month in the present day. The expert attributes this decline to the fact that people are now constantly connected and have less \"quiet empty time\" to devote to their partners.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3-8B-chat-hf", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
