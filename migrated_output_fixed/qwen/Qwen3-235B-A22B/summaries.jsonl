Only UKIP and the DUP commit to maintaining the 2% threshold.  \n- **Capability gaps**: Lack of Maritime Patrol Aircraft, reliance on NATO allies for submarine defense, and under-equipped aircraft carriers (e.g., Queen Elizabeth-class carriers to operate only 12 F-35 jets instead of 36).  \n- **Trident nuclear deterrent**: Conservatives and UKIP support renewal (\u00a320bn for four submarines), Labour proposes reducing submarines from four to three, Lib Dems favor ending continuous patrols, while SNP/Greens oppose it.  \n- **Political and military concerns**: Analysts warn of further cuts due to fiscal constraints, but parties avoid firm commitments. Military leaders fear a \"hollow force\" with advanced equipment but insufficient personnel. The US may question UK credibility if defense spending lags, undermining its global influence.  \n- **Strategic uncertainty**: Trident renewal may face review post-election, especially if coalition dynamics shift, and the next government must address balancing conventional forces with nuclear spending.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-235B-A22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
