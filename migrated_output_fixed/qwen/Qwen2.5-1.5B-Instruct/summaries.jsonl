Researchers from Finland analyzed the weight and height of nearly 12, 000 two-year-olds, comparing them against antibiotic prescription records. The study found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received repeated antibiotics before the age of two were especially predisposed to becoming overweight. The lead author, Dr. Antti Saari, warns that antibiotics might cause weight gain due to killing off beneficial gut bacteria, which can then free up more food for the body. He also notes that this effect may contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic, particularly affecting boys. The study does not definitively link antibiotics directly to weight gain but highlights the potential impact of antibiotic usage on child health.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The author suggests this trend could be due to increased internet access, which has blurred the distinction between personal and professional life, making it harder for couples to find quiet moments together.
