Critics, including a homeless group, argue that the relationship between the charity and the company is unethical, as the letting agent profits by placing multiple unrelated individuals in one property and charging housing benefit for each person.

Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK and has been highly profitable, with some properties generating significant annual profits.

This map, which covers 0.4% of the sky, reveals clumps of dark matter and is part of a series that aims to eventually create a 3D view of dark matter across 12.5% of the night sky over five years. The map was made using data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile, and it helps astronomers study galaxy formation and the nature of dark energy. Dark matter, which constitutes about 85% of the universe's matter, cannot be directly observed but can be detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter. The map uses gravitational lensing to show distortions in light caused by dark matter, and it is expected to provide insights into the universe's expansion and the distribution of mass. The project, part of the Dark Energy Survey, is expected to be completed by 2018.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-8B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
