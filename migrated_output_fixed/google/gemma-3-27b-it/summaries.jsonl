Parties are largely vague on defence policy in their manifestos, and further cuts are likely, though some parties (Conservatives, UKIP) have made commitments to maintain or renew certain aspects like Trident and army size, creating fiscal challenges.

The industry, though small (0.5% of GDP, 12,000 workers), must not be marginalized in negotiations. The report suggests retaining elements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and adhering to scientific advice for quotas, while also noting potential complications from differing fisheries management regimes within the UK nations.
