Recent years have been bad - 30% down on the boom - with a member of staff having to be laid off. But he can now see a turnaround.\nFianna F\u00c3\u00a1il, the main opposition party, is highly critical of how the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is dealing with the midlands, arguing that the half-a-billion euro investment in water meters that won't be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement.\nIts local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area.\nThe government says it is doing its bit for County Longford, with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Parcs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Ballymahon in the county when it opens in 2019.\nHowever, the proposed 200m euro (\u00c2\u00a3146m) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission.\nNevertheless, James Bannon, the local Fine Gael TD, is confident the venture will be a success.\nThe Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business.\nSo, the message coming from the midlands is that while it, too, is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done.", "company": "google", "model_name": "test-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He was born in 1946 and grew up in Southern California. After graduating from high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as an orderly in a naval field hospital. This experience inspired him to become a doctor and to pursue a career in research.\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Venter began working at the US National Institute of Health. He quickly realized the importance of decoding genes, and he developed a new method for doing so that was much faster than the existing methods. This work led to the publication of the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to sequence the entire human genome. This effort was completed in 2001, just three years after it began. Venter's work on the human genome made him a household name, and he was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2008.\n\nIn 2006, Venter founded the J Craig Venter Institute, which is dedicated to the research and development of synthetic life forms. In 2010, the institute announced the creation of the world's first synthetic cell.\n\nVenter is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he has made a significant impact on the field of human genomics. He is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology, and his work has the potential to revolutionize the way we live.", "company": "google", "model_name": "test-bison-001", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
