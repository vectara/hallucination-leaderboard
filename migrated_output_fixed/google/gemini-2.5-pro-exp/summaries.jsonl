Research indicates that sexual frequency among Britons has decreased since the emergence of the internet, with typical heterosexual couples now having sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter suggests that increased technological connectivity has blurred the lines between public and private lives, home and work, reducing quiet time as people constantly check emails. This busyness squeezes out time for partners.
