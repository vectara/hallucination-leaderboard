Research shows that the frequency of sex for Britons has been declining since the emergence of the internet. A typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, a decrease from four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. The professor suggests that because people are now better connected technologically and constantly checking emails, the boundaries between home and work have eroded, squeezing out time that would have been spent with partners. Researcher Catherine Mercer adds that with competing demands on time, sex becomes a lower priority, and being connected to work emails late in the evening makes it difficult to focus on a partner.", "company": "google", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
