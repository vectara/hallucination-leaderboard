The APC's gains have relegated the PDP to a regional party, with the APC controlling most northern states and Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.

His work in genomics led to significant advancements, including the creation of the first synthetic life form, Synthia, developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute. Born in 1946, Venter's early life was marked by a lack of academic focus until his experiences in the Vietnam War inspired a profound sense of urgency and a commitment to medicine and research. His career in molecular biology began at the US National Institute of Health, where he pioneered faster gene sequencing methods, leading to the first complete genome of a free-living organism in 1995. Venter's establishment of Celera Genomics in 1998 to decode the human genome in three years challenged the public Human Genome Project and sparked controversy over data access and scientific conventions. Despite criticism, Venter's achievements have provided him with the resources to pursue independent research, including oceanographic studies to sequence marine microbes and efforts to develop synthetic microbes for environmental and industrial applications. His work continues to provoke debate but also holds the promise of significant scientific and environmental breakthroughs.", "company": "deepseek-ai", "model_name": "DeepSeek-V3", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

School meals are seen as a way to expand children's diets and introduce healthier options, with modern school meals adhering to strict nutritional guidelines. About 40% of primary school children in England eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools, while Scotland has a higher rate at 46%.

A Canadian study of 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations found that oophorectomy reduced the risk of breast cancer death by 62% in BRCA1 carriers, though not in BRCA2 carriers. The procedure also led to a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The study highlights that oophorectomy is most effective when performed soon after diagnosis, with a 73% reduction in death for BRCA1 carriers who had the surgery within two years. The protective effect lasts up to 15 years. The findings suggest oophorectomy should be considered as part of treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations significantly increase lifetime breast cancer risk (50-80%) and ovarian cancer risk. Genetic testing is available for these mutations, which are more common in Ashkenazi Jewish women.

Previously, these dogs could fetch prices up to \u00a31.2 million, but due to a combination of factors, including the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign, bans on owning large dogs in several cities, and overbreeding, their value has plummeted. Wealthy individuals previously used these dogs as gifts to influence officials, but the anti-corruption drive has made such practices risky. Additionally, urbanization has highlighted the breed's unsuitability for city living. As a result, many Tibetan Mastiffs are now being sent to slaughterhouses, with their meat used in cheap hotpots and their skins for leather. Animal welfare workers have rescued some dogs from inhumane conditions, but many continue to face cruel fates.
