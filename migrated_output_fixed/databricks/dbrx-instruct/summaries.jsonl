The study, conducted by Finnish researchers, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-old children with antibiotic prescription records. The results showed that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years of age, and those who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. The study suggests that the overuse of antibiotics could be contributing to the obesity epidemic, as antibiotics may kill beneficial gut bacteria that help regulate weight. The study did not prove causation, but the researchers warned that the over-prescription of antibiotics could have unintended consequences.", "company": "databricks", "model_name": "dbrx-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Five former England managers, including Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren, have backed Dyke's proposal, warning that the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals. The managers believe that the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking, and that the current rules make it harder for England to win the World Cup. They also point out that while there are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, these players are not being given enough opportunities.

The dialogue is seen as a means to address opposition demands, but Sheikh Salman insists that the government must be willing to offer concrete solutions. The Crown Prince, Salman al-Khalifa, is viewed as a reformist within the royal family, but there are hardliners in the government, including the Prime Minister, who are opposed to making concessions. Sheikh Salman believes that dialogue and negotiations are necessary and that working with reformists within the royal family is the only way forward. He also calls for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been imprisoned. The al-Wefaq leader is hopeful that the new US Secretary of State, John Kerry, will take a more active role in pushing for human rights and democratic practices in Bahrain. He also criticizes the UK's approach, stating that private conversations urging reform are not enough and that public pressure is needed. Despite the ban on public gatherings, al-Wefaq will continue to call for peaceful demonstrations as a means to put pressure on the government.", "company": "databricks", "model_name": "dbrx-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

At its peak, nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers had offices within a half-mile radius. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702. The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socializing and seeking stories. The departure of the last two journalists from Fleet Street, Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, marks the end of an era. The decline of Fleet Street began in 1986 when media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to a purpose-built complex in Wapping, east London. By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new computerized printing technology.

They found ancient earthworks, possibly 2,000 years old, which were concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation allowed their discovery. The team, which also includes researchers from the universities of Exeter, Reading, and Brazil's S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Bel\u00c3\u00a9m, investigated more than 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\". The function of these sites is still not well understood, but they are thought to have been used as ritual gathering places, similar to the Maya pyramids of Central America or Britain's Stonehenge. Dr Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs and found that they were constructed among taller vegetation, which suggests that they were not visible above the forest canopy. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems before the arrival of Europeans, but were instead transformed by humans through the use of \"agroforestry\" practices, which involved concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms. The team suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "databricks", "model_name": "dbrx-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This initiative comes after doctors visited Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that patients in Wales without clear symptoms are waiting too long for a diagnosis, as they do not easily fit into specific treatment pathways. This results in general practitioners referring patients back and forth for multiple tests, which can take several weeks. The fear is that too many patients start treatment when their cancer has already progressed or is incurable.\n\nThe new scheme will allow 40 general practitioners in the Cynon Valley to refer patients they suspect may have cancer to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days. It is estimated that six patients per week will be seen and undergo various tests, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with symptoms that cause concern receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors aim to reach the majority of patients without such obvious symptoms earlier. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.

However, the breed's popularity has since plummeted, with many of the dogs being sent to slaughterhouses and their meat used for cheap hotpots.

A recent rescue of 20 Tibetan Mastiffs, who were being transported to a slaughterhouse, highlights the cruel fate that many of these dogs are facing.
