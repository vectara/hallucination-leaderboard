In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, though the overall percentage of people who drink remained stable. Changing social norms, particularly increased acceptability for women to drink heavily, were cited as key drivers alongside factors like cheaper alcohol, increased advertising, weakened alcohol control policies, and affluence. The study noted significant geographic variation, with Menominee County, WI, having the highest binge drinking rate at 36% and Esmeralda County, NV, having the most heavy drinkers at 22%.
