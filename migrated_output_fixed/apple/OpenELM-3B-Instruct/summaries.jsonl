Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of killing his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012. Costa allegedly stomped on Freebody's head, cut his throat and stabbed him multiple times. Costa made triple 0 calls during the attack, suggesting his confused mental state. Costa's state of mind is critical to the case, as the jury must determine whether his unstable mindset at the time of the attack can be proven.", "company": "apple", "model_name": "OpenELM-3B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The untried Barkley took the 10th minute kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon \u2013 rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it.
