Prime Minister David Cameron has urged First Great Western (FGW) to urgently review its decision to nearly double fares on the London to Cotswolds route through his constituency. For example, off-peak returns from Charlbury to London will rise from \u00a333.30 to \u00a362.40. FGW justifies the hike by aligning prices with other routes and offers cheaper advanced single tickets as alternatives. Other companies, including Virgin and London Midlands, also plan increases ranging from 22% to 40% on various routes. Virgin states most increases apply to their discounted \"virgin trains-only\" fares, with an overall increase of 1.65% on the West Coast line, below industry average.

Women's binge drinking rates increased much faster than men's, with significant regional variations across U.S. counties. Despite rises in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of people drinking alcohol remained stable. The study links these trends to changing social norms, economic factors, lower alcohol prices, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol regulations.
