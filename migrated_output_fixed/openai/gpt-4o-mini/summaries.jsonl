Poorer young people are also significantly more likely to be placed under statutory supervision. The study indicates that extreme poverty correlates with higher rates of both victimization and perpetration of crime, and gender plays a role, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violence.

While fishing communities largely supported leaving the EU, the House of Lords report warns that these communities risk being marginalized in negotiations. The report emphasizes the need for continued market access for the UK fishing industry, which contributes minimally to GDP and employs few people. It notes potential trade-offs, as EU states may demand more access to UK waters in exchange for tariff-free fish exports. The report also suggests retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) post-Brexit and maintaining scientific-based quotas. Despite concerns, some in the industry remain optimistic about future opportunities outside the EU, citing recent increases in allowable catches. The government expresses a desire to ensure fair access to quotas and sustainable fisheries management during negotiations.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini", "date_code": "2024-07-18", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
