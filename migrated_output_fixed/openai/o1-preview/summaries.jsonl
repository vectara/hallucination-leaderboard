Researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as infants being particularly affected. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two further increased the likelihood of being overweight, especially among boys, who were also found to be slightly taller than their peers who had not received antibiotics.\n\nThe study suggests that antibiotics may disrupt gut bacteria that normally aid in metabolism, potentially leading to increased appetite and weight gain. Although causation was not established, lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that such exposure could play a role in the global childhood obesity epidemic, which is more pronounced in boys. The findings align with concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics contributing to unintended health consequences, including obesity, eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, there is growing worry that antibiotic overuse may lead to the emergence of superbugs, with the government warning of a new strain that could infect up to 200,000 Britons and cause 80,000 deaths in a single outbreak.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone.\" \u00d6zil obtained the watch ahead of its general release on Friday.\n\n\u00d6zil, who has scored four goals in 25 matches across all competitions this season, is expected to start in Sunday's encounter. Arsenal trails Chelsea by ten points with six league games remaining but is buoyed by the return of midfielder Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench during their FA Cup semi-final victory over Reading after spending five months sidelined due to injury.\n\nClub legend Ray Parlour spoke highly of Wilshere, asserting that he is the future of Arsenal if he can maintain his fitness. Parlour highlighted Wilshere's quality and potential impact on the team but expressed concerns over his injury history, drawing parallels with teammate Abou Diaby's struggles to stay fit over the past few years. Wilshere was recently pictured training at London Colney, signaling his readiness to contribute to Arsenal's pivotal end-of-season fixtures.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and about five times more likely to be placed under statutory supervision compared to their more affluent peers committing the same offenses. Poverty also exacerbates the risk of violence among both boys and girls. While boys are generally three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, girls from poorer households are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime as those from wealthier backgrounds, even when accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and poor parental supervision.\n\nThe research indicates that a history of trouble with the police is the strongest predictor of a young person being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18. It suggests that involvement with the juvenile justice system may inadvertently reinforce the conditions that perpetuate violence. Another study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) reveals that despite overall crime rates in Scotland reaching a 41-year low, the most deprived communities have not benefited from this decline. Crime remains highly concentrated among poor individuals and neighborhoods, which also suffer from high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about whether the Scottish government is effectively addressing inequality. In response, a government spokesman emphasized that Scotland has become safer, with significant reductions in recorded crime and homicide rates, and highlighted a \u00a3296 million investment aimed at mitigating poverty and inequality to protect the most vulnerable in society.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These structures, possibly 2,000 years old, were concealed beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest and were revealed due to modern deforestation. The function of these geoglyphs remains uncertain; they are unlikely to be villages or defensive sites due to few artefacts found and their non-defensive layouts. Instead, they may have served as ritual gathering places, similar to Central America's Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. However, unlike those monuments, these geoglyphs were constructed among tall vegetation and were likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n\nDr. Loader analyzed soil samples from the geoglyphs, studying phytoliths to reconstruct ancient vegetation, charcoal quantities to assess forest burning, and carbon stable isotopes to determine past vegetation types. The research suggests that ancient peoples transformed their environment not by large-scale burning but by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms, indicating early agroforestry practices. This challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems untouched by humans before European arrival in the 16th century. The team likens this to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests today may still reflect these ancient practices.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

By comparing full-time males with full-time females and part-time males with part-time females, the researchers eliminated the impact of part-time status on earnings. The study found no evidence supporting the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggests that women avoid requesting higher pay due to reluctance or fear of upsetting their employer. When comparing similar male and female workers, men were 25% more likely to receive a pay increase when they asked. The researchers accounted for factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications.\n\nThe data was sourced from the 2013-14 Australian Workplace Relations Survey, noted for systematically recording whether employees had asked for a pay rise and their reasons. Professor Andrew Oswald expressed surprise at the findings and suggested that the results might indicate an element of discrimination against women. The study also observed that among workers under 40, both women and men asked for and received pay raises at similar rates, suggesting a shift in negotiating behaviors.

Despite increasing global instability\u2014evidenced by mass migrations from failed states, the threat of Islamic extremism, and a more assertive Russia\u2014the UK is reducing its military capabilities. The regular Army is shrinking from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel, the Royal Navy operates just 19 warships, and the Royal Air Force is down to eight, soon to be seven, front-line fast jet squadrons. Additionally, the UK has gaps in capabilities, such as lacking Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relying on NATO allies to monitor Russian submarines near its waters.\n\nDefence spending is declining, with the UK falling from the fourth to the sixth largest global defence spender, now trailing behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and France. A significant point of contention is the commitment to NATO's guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defence\u2014a target only UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party pledge to meet. Projections indicate UK defence spending may drop to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, or even 1.5% with further cuts.\n\nFuture governments are expected to implement additional defence budget reductions as they strive to decrease the national deficit. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), holding one of the largest unprotected budgets at \u00a334 billion annually, faces potential cuts of \u00a32-3 billion per year. While the Conservatives have committed to replacing the Trident nuclear deterrent, increasing the equipment budget by 1% annually, and maintaining army personnel levels, these promises constrain their ability to find savings without impacting their fiscal plans. Labour has avoided making similar commitments, and military leaders anticipate inevitable cuts.\n\nThe renewal of the Trident nuclear programme is a divisive issue. The Conservatives and UKIP support a full like-for-like replacement at an estimated cost of at least \u00a320 billion, accounting for a quarter of the MoD's equipment budget over the next decade. Labour proposes maintaining continuous at-sea deterrence with potentially three submarines instead of four, the Liberal Democrats suggest a reduced \"part-time deterrent,\" and the SNP and Greens advocate for scrapping it entirely.

The concern is that patients without clear symptoms wait too long for a diagnosis because they don't fit into specific treatment pathways, leading to delays as they undergo multiple tests over several weeks. The pilot allows 40 doctors in the Cynon Valley to refer such patients to a diagnostic centre at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital within seven days. An estimated six patients per week will be seen and tested, ideally on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area.

Savage observes that Liverpool are currently far from the level required to contend for the Premier League title and may struggle to secure a top-four finish. This downturn is partly due to the team overachieving last season, which has led to unrealistic expectations among fans.\n\nSavage critiques manager Brendan Rodgers' transfer decisions, particularly in replacing strikers Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. The current forward options\u2014Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, and Fabio Borini\u2014are deemed insufficient, lacking both goal-scoring prowess and the high work-rate that characterized Liverpool's attack last season. This deficiency has resulted in a significant drop in early goals and a lack of pressing intensity, leaving the team often chasing games.\n\nDefensive frailties persist despite substantial investments in players like Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren. The back line lacks leadership, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's hesitance to command his area exacerbates the issue. Set-piece effectiveness has also declined sharply, removing a crucial source of goals from the previous campaign.\n\nAhead of the clash with Chelsea, Savage proposes a lineup that includes Kolo Toure over Lovren, citing Toure's solid performance against Real Madrid. He emphasizes the need for disciplined full-backs and a dynamic midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, and Raheem Sterling to challenge Chelsea's robust defense. However, Savage concedes that even with these adjustments, it's difficult to envision Liverpool defeating a Chelsea side that appears superior in all facets of the game.\n\nAddressing Steven Gerrard's situation, Savage acknowledges the psychological and physical hurdles the 34-year-old faces. Despite the infamous slip against Chelsea that marred last season and ongoing speculation about his future, Gerrard remains one of Liverpool's key players. Savage believes Gerrard's experience, skill set, and enduring fitness make him integral to the team's long-term plans. He commends Gerrard's resilience and continued contributions, underscoring his status as one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders.\n\nOverall, Savage's analysis underscores the significant challenges Liverpool face in replicating past successes and the critical decisions required to restore their competitiveness at the highest level.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The goal is to provide broadband internet access to every corner of the globe, with a particular focus on connecting all schools. To achieve this, Airbus is revolutionizing satellite manufacturing by adopting high-volume, low-cost production methods akin to automobile and airplane assembly lines. This approach aims to produce three satellites per shift at a cost of less than a million dollars each.\n\nThe first assembly line has been inaugurated in Toulouse, France, with two additional lines planned for a new factory in Florida.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, glaciers descending from Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains covered approximately 375 square kilometers. By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to about 275 square kilometers, marking an average loss of 26%. The research, conducted by Marie Gardent and colleagues from the University of Savoie, assessed around 600 glaciers across several massifs, including Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nUsing historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, the team verified glacier boundaries through manual inspection to account for issues like debris cover and shadowing that can affect automatic delineation methods. The retreat is not uniform across the region; southern sectors like the Belledonne Massif have seen glaciers nearly disappear, and the Ecrins Massif has experienced retreat over three times greater than that of the Mont Blanc Massif. Factors contributing to the greater losses in the south include lower elevations and different climatic conditions, such as less precipitation and cloud cover compared to the northern Alps.\n\nThe northern Alps, which receive more precipitation, have experienced less significant glacier retreat. For instance, France's largest glacier, La Mer de Glace on Mont Blanc, has seen a slight area reduction from 31.5 square kilometers in the late 1960s to just over 30 square kilometers in the late 2000s. This study mirrors findings in other parts of the Alps, including Switzerland, where accelerated glacier mass loss has also been reported. The ongoing efforts to monitor glacier health underscore the broader impacts of climate variations across the Alpine region.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Fishing regions voted heavily for Brexit, hoping to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation akin to Norway. However, the industry contributes only 0.5% to the UK's GDP and employs about 12,000 fishers, which may make it a low priority for the government.\n\nThe report highlights that most commercial fish stocks are in waters shared with EU states, and the majority of UK-caught fish are exported to the EU, while much of the fish consumed in the UK is imported from EU countries. Continued access to the EU market is crucial for the industry's success but may come at the cost of allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\nThe Committee suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), such as basing quotas on scientific advice and cooperating with neighboring countries. There is also concern that leaving the CFP framework could lead to fragmented fisheries management across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry representatives are optimistic. They point to recent increases in allowable catches under the CFP as a positive sign and believe that Brexit will grant the UK full control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, leading to fairer catch shares and improved sustainable fisheries management.

He emphasizes that quality apprenticeships are crucial for social mobility and that the current system hinders economic competitiveness and access to skilled jobs for young people.\n\nThe Department for Education responds that it is reforming apprenticeships to improve standards, including making them more rigorous and ensuring they last a minimum of a year with increased focus on English and maths. The Association of Colleges agrees on prioritizing level three apprenticeships but argues that respected level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, should be preserved. They acknowledge the challenge in creating more apprenticeship opportunities due to the current shortage of places for 16-year-olds and emphasize the need for high-quality facilities, expert teaching, and improved career guidance.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines heavy drinking as consuming more than one drink per day for women and more than two for men over the past month; binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n\nThe increase is largely driven by changing social norms affecting women's drinking habits. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women rose more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates increased nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared to a 23% increase among men.\n\nIn 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers, while the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained relatively unchanged. The study, the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, highlighted regional variations: Madison County, Idaho, had the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, whereas Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest at 36%; Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers at 2%, and Esmeralda County, Nevada, had the most at 22%.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in excessive drinking, including increased alcohol advertising expenditures (about $3.45 billion in 2011), alcohol becoming cheaper due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, weakened alcohol control policies, and the influence of affluent professionals in urban areas who may engage in hard-partying lifestyles. Young people and wealthier individuals are more likely to binge drink, and changing social norms have made it more acceptable for women to drink heavily.\n\nAlcohol-related issues have significant societal costs, with approximately 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of excessive drinking exceeding $220 billion. While more individuals are seeking treatment for alcoholism, many do not seek help unless faced with serious consequences like job loss or legal issues.\n\nThe findings are based on data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older, collected through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A video capturing the face of the assailant and a dossier containing names and car registration numbers of suspected saboteurs were provided to Wiltshire Police.\n\nDespite this evidence, the police have halted their investigation due to insufficient evidence to proceed, a decision that has left Lane and hunt supporters feeling let down and dismayed. The Countryside Alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing face coverings to help identify and bring criminals to justice. Wiltshire Police stated that the case has been recorded as undetected but will be reopened if further evidence emerges.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "o1-preview", "date_code": "2024-09-12", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Researchers from the University of Manchester, led by Dr. Sarah Bridle, spent two years measuring the shapes of galaxies to construct the map, which was released at the American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570-megapixel imaging device used in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) based at the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.\n\nCovering about 0.4% of the sky, the map displays clumps of dark matter by detecting the distortion of light from distant galaxies\u2014a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Since dark matter does not emit or block light, its presence is inferred from these gravitational effects. The DES aims to map 12.5% of the sky over five years, creating a comprehensive 3D map of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe findings support theories that galaxies form in areas with large concentrations of dark matter due to stronger gravitational forces. The maps reveal large filaments of matter where galaxies and clusters reside, as well as cosmic voids with few galaxies. Analyzing the clumpiness of dark matter will help scientists understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to cause the accelerated expansion of the universe. The project involves analyzing 130 million images of galaxies, a task that requires substantial computational resources, including some of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

The harassment ranged from verbal insults and intimidating behaviors\u2014such as insistent flirting, whistling, and comments on appearance\u2014to more severe offenses like sexual assault or rape. Many women remain unaware they have been harassed due to societal conditioning that normalizes low-level abuse.\n\nThese pervasive experiences have led six out of ten women to fear attacks on public transport, compared to three out of ten men. As a result, women often alter their daily routines by changing routes, modes of transportation, schedules, attitudes, and clothing to avoid confrontation, effectively limiting their freedom and participation in public life. The report, presented to the French women's rights ministry, calls for campaigns to combat sexist and threatening behavior on buses and trains.\n\nPascale Boistard, president of the High Council for Gender Equality\u2014which compiled the report\u2014expressed surprise at the widespread nature of the problem and affirmed that women must be able to move freely without fear or threat. Ernestine Ronai, also from the council, noted that attackers often feel they can act with impunity by blending into crowds. She emphasized the importance of educating women that such experiences are not normal and stressed that touching someone inappropriately constitutes sexual assault, punishable by up to five years in prison and a \u20ac75,005 fine.
