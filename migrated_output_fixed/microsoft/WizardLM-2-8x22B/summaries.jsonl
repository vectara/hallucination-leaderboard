He also singled out Olivier Giroud, suggesting that Arsenal's chances of winning the league would be limited if Giroud remains the primary striker, despite Giroud's 14 league goals that season. Henry compared Arsenal's situation to Chelsea's, noting that Chelsea's purchases of players like Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, and Diego Costa significantly improved their team and put them in a position to win the league.

The report suggests that this could raise \u00a34.5 billion annually, enough to build between 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, potentially the largest social house building program since the 1970s. Policy Exchange's director, Neil O'Brien, argues that while social housing would still exist in expensive areas, there would be less of it, and that no one has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. He estimates that the scheme could reduce the social housing waiting list by about 500,000.\n\nDowning Street supports the report, emphasizing that councils already have the option to sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing. The government believes this could help address the growing waiting list for social housing.\n\nHowever, the Labour Party opposes the idea, stating that the coalition's policies are exacerbating the housing crisis. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey suggests using a bank bonus tax to fund affordable housing and stimulate the construction industry.\n\nThe report defines expensive social housing as properties worth more than the regional average, which accounts for 21.8% of the UK's total social housing stock. Policy Exchange estimates that selling 3.5% of the total stock that becomes vacant each year could raise \u00a35.5 billion, or \u00a34.5 billion after debt repayment.\n\nCritics of the proposal worry that it would lead to the displacement of low-income families from affluent areas, creating segregated communities. The National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck express concerns about the social consequences of such a policy.\n\nIn contrast, Housing Minister Grant Shapps supports the sell-off, citing the government's investment in affordable housing and the introduction of fixed-term tenancies to prioritize those in greatest need.\n\nIn summary, the passage outlines Policy Exchange's proposal to sell vacant high-value social homes to fund new social housing construction, with support from the government and opposition from the Labour Party and housing organizations, who are concerned about the social impact of the policy.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The British Geological Survey (BGS) reported that the recent tremor had a similar location and mechanism to an earlier one on 1 April.\n3.

Cuadrilla's CEO, Mark Miller, stated that the company is taking its responsibilities seriously and will analyze data and consult with experts before deciding whether to resume drilling, a process expected to take several weeks.\n5. Fracking has been controversial in the US due to environmental concerns, including the potential for gas to leak into drinking water, possibly causing it to ignite.\n6. The UK's Commons energy select committee has recommended that the government support fracking, suggesting that environmental issues seen in the US can be mitigated with strict regulation and industry best practices.\n7. The BGS is monitoring seismic activity related to fracking as a precautionary measure.\n8. Since fracking began in Lancashire in March, there have been two minor earthquakes, including the most recent one.\n9. The BGS's analysis of the April quake indicates that injecting pressurized water into rocks can cause fractures and potentially trigger earthquakes, which is a known side effect of oil extraction and geothermal engineering processes, including shale gas extraction.\n10.

He has also monitored McGregor's training progress and advised his camp to hire a boxing referee, leading to the hiring of Joe Cortez, who reported an intense sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. Malignaggi left McGregor's camp following the release of images showing him on the canvas during sparring.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Fleet Street was once the epicenter of the nation's newspaper industry, with the first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, published there in 1702. It was a prestigious location for journalists, with nearly every national paper having an office in the area. The street was known for its vibrant culture, including numerous bars and pubs where journalists would socialize and gather stories.\n\nTwo reporters, Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, who worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, are highlighted as the last journalists working on Fleet Street. Sherriff, who spent 32 years there, recalls the smoke-filled newsrooms, typewriters, and the challenges of the old printing technology. Smith, based in Fleet Street for 25 years, shares anecdotes about the street's history, including its association with Sweeney Todd and the notorious El Vino wine bar.\n\nThe passage also mentions the decline of Fleet Street's dominance, initiated by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's relocation of his newspapers to Wapping in 1986, which led to a significant dispute and the eventual adoption of new printing technology by most national newspapers. This shift resulted in the transformation of the iconic Fleet Street buildings into various other businesses.\n\nFormer Sunday Express editor Robin Esser reflects on the importance of Fleet Street in an era before television and social media, when newspapers were the primary source of public information. Liz Hodgkinson, who worked in Fleet Street during the 70s and 80s, provides insight into the culture of heavy drinking and the challenges faced by women in the industry.\n\nThe closure of the Sunday Post's London office symbolizes the end of Fleet Street's role in British journalism. While Sherriff plans to write his memoirs, Smith will continue as a freelance journalist. The passage concludes by acknowledging the emotional significance of Fleet Street to those who worked there and its lasting impact on British history.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The exercise involves the German U-boat U33 acting as an enemy submarine, with the objective of evading detection by NATO forces, including the USS Vicksburg and HMS Portland, to \"take out\" the command ship and an oil tanker. The difficulty of locating a submarine in the vast ocean is emphasized, with the task being compared to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nRear Admiral Brad Williamson highlights the importance of the training in light of recent Russian submarine sightings near Sweden, Finland, and the UK. Lieutenant Colin Ryan, the anti-submarine warfare officer aboard the USS Vicksburg, acknowledges the challenge of detecting submarines that can remain hidden for extended periods.\n\nThe passage notes that while many European countries have reduced their defense spending, Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has significantly invested in its military, particularly its submarine fleet, which now includes around 60 submarines. Russia's recent launch of a submarine claimed to be the \"quietest in the world\" underscores the country's advancements in submarine technology.\n\nPeter Roberts from the defense think tank RUSI describes Russia's submarines as highly advanced, with skilled crews, making them the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world.\" These submarines can remain undetected for months and are capable of \"fingerprinting\" the vessels of other nations.\n\nThe exercise employs a range of assets to detect submarines, including anti-submarine warfare helicopters and, for the first time, underwater drones deployed by a NATO research vessel.

This decision has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some criticizing it as a departure from tradition, as only two other First Ladies have not resided in the White House during their husbands' presidencies. Others support Melania's choice, viewing it as a responsible parenting decision.\n\nHistorical context is provided by White House Historical Association historian William Seale, who notes that it is not uncommon for presidential children to finish their school year before moving, and that past presidents' children have also faced educational transitions. The passage also touches on the role of the First Lady, which is largely ceremonial but has evolved to include advocacy for various causes. Melania Trump has indicated that her focus will be on her son, suggesting a less public role than her predecessors.\n\nThe passage further explores the historical precedents for First Ladies who have been less visible or have had their duties performed by others, such as daughters or daughters-in-law. It also mentions the balance previous First Families have struck between public duties and private family life, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normalcy for children in the White House.\n\nIn summary, the passage covers Melania Trump's decision to postpone moving to the White House for her son's educational stability, the public's varied reactions to this choice, historical examples of how presidential families have managed similar situations, the evolving role of the First Lady, and the balance between public service and private family life in the White House.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Evidence indicates that over 6,000 years, humans introduced a variety of plant species, suggesting that the region was subject to ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.

It also considered factors such as employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications. The data used for the analysis came from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey, which uniquely records whether employees requested a pay increase and their reasons for doing so or not. The findings suggest that the discrepancy in pay raise success rates between men and women may be due to discrimination rather than women's reluctance to ask.

The program focuses on patients who exhibit no clear symptoms or signs of cancer but are suspected to be at risk. This initiative follows a visit by local doctors to Denmark to observe their diagnostic systems, which have been credited with improving cancer diagnosis rates.\n\nThe concern in Wales is that patients without clear symptoms may wait too long for a diagnosis and may not fit neatly into specific treatment pathways. General practitioners (GPs) often refer these patients for multiple tests over several weeks. Consequently, there is a fear that too many patients start treatment when their cancer is too advanced to be effectively treated.\n\nIn Cwm Cynon, 40 GPs believe that referring patients to the diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days could lead to a more efficient process. The plan is for around six patients per week to be seen and to undergo different tests on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with \"borderline\" symptoms receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area, and doctors aim to reach more of the patient population without such clear symptoms.\n\nA similar trial clinic is being set up at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another pilot program by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.

GPs who are unsure about a patient's condition but have concerns can quickly refer them to the clinic, ensuring prompt attention and hopefully a swift diagnosis.\n\nGP Dr. Gareth Jordan from Aberdare suggests that the pilot program could make a significant difference in patients' lives by providing timely and coordinated specialist opinions, which is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment.\n\nIf the Cwm Cynon pilot program, set to begin within six months, is successful, other health boards in the region are expected to offer the same service subsequently.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Mr Swinney criticized Chancellor George Osborne for planning real-terms cuts for Scotland every year until 2020, with over \u00a31bn in cuts still to come. He argued that the UK government could have reduced debt and the deficit without such extensive cuts.\n5. Despite the financial constraints, Mr Swinney pledged to protect essential services like schools, hospitals, and the police from the UK government's austerity measures. He pointed to past achievements such as increased police numbers, lower crime rates, improved education, tuition-free university education, and a record-high health budget as evidence of the Scottish government's priorities.\n6. A UK government Scotland Office spokesman responded by highlighting the \u00a3390m increase in Scotland's spending power next year, which could reach \u00a3750m if the Scottish government's underspend is included. The spokesman emphasized the stability of the UK economy and the block grant nearing \u00a330bn, suggesting that this situation is preferable to the Scottish government's favored constitutional alternative, especially given the current oil prices.\n7. Labour's public services spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, challenged Mr Swinney to move beyond rhetoric and present a substantive budget that addresses long-term needs, criticizing the SNP's approach to austerity and calling for different tax decisions than those made by the Tories and the SNP.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Commission suggested that electoral registers, currently managed by local councils, should be better integrated to prevent duplicate entries. Despite a record 46.8 million people registered to vote, with a significant surge in applications after the snap election was announced, there were issues with duplicate applications due to the lack of direct linkage between the online registration system and the electoral registers. This resulted in a high proportion of duplicate applications, ranging from 30% to 70% in different areas, causing administrative and financial strain on electoral officials. The watchdog recommended clearer information on registration sites and potentially a verification function similar to those used in Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland. Although there was no concrete evidence of double voting, the Commission emphasized the seriousness of the offense and called for a system that would allow people registered in two seats to choose their voting location in advance for general elections.

The study, which included a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools, revealed that while tablet computers are increasingly prevalent in education, with 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools using them to some extent, there is no clear evidence that they improve academic performance. The study found that tablets are most intensively used in academy schools compared to independent or other state schools, with 9% of schools providing a tablet for every pupil. The number of tablets in schools is expected to nearly double between 2014 and 2016, from approximately 430,000 to almost 900,000.\n\nDespite the growing trend, Dr. Clarke emphasizes that it is not possible to definitively link tablet usage to better academic results, as the impact of technology on attainment cannot be isolated. However, head teachers have reported positive impacts, such as increased motivation among pupils who might otherwise be disengaged, and greater family involvement when tablets are taken home. Dr. Clarke predicts that the role of technology in schools will continue to expand.\n\nA separate study by the National Literacy Trust and Pearson suggests that touch-screen computers, including tablets, are particularly beneficial for boys and poorer pupils in learning to read. It also indicates that children from lower-income households are more likely to read on touch-screen devices than on printed books.\n\nThe study highlights that online technology is deeply integrated into young people's daily lives, with a quarter of secondary pupils in schools where every student has a tablet considering themselves internet \"addicts.\" Many pupils take devices to bed for social media or watching videos.

The key elements of the summary are:\n\n1. A team from Wales visited Aarhus, Denmark, to learn about their healthcare model, which was revamped due to alarming cancer survival rates over 15 years ago.\n2. The problem identified was long waiting times for diagnosis, particularly for patients with vague or difficult-to-diagnose symptoms, and those needing quick tests or scans to rule out serious illnesses.\n3. The new Danish model introduced three diagnostic routes:\n   a. Fast-track routes for patients with \"alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers, with strict time targets.\n   b. Diagnosis centres established in 2007 for patients with undiagnosed symptoms, providing quick tests and scans to determine the cause, whether cancer or otherwise.\n   c. \"Yes-no\" centres for patients with minor symptoms unlikely to be cancer but requiring quick assessment to identify rare cases of serious disease.\n4. The changes have not resulted in an overwhelming increase in GP referrals but have improved the organization and efficiency of the diagnostic process within existing resources.\n5. The results have been positive, with Denmark showing improved survival rates and catching up to other Scandinavian countries.\n6. The Danish system, similar to Wales in funding and organization, offers lessons for Wales in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment through better coordination between GPs and specialists.\n\nIn essence, the passage outlines Denmark's successful reorganization of cancer diagnosis pathways to improve efficiency, reduce waiting times, and enhance survival rates, with potential lessons for Wales' healthcare system.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Apple has introduced a two-step verification process for iCloud, which is an opt-in feature that adds an extra layer of security by requiring a four-digit code after the usual username and password on new devices. This code is sent to a trusted mobile phone or through the Find My iPhone app. Without this code, access to iCloud and purchases on Apple's digital stores is denied, although a recovery key is available for account access if the trusted device is lost or stolen.\n\nPreviously, two-step verification did not apply to Apple's back-up service, allowing attackers to download complete back-ups even if two-step verification was enabled. The recent changes by Apple prevent this by requiring the second step for back-up access as well. Vladimir Katalov, owner of Elcomsoft, confirmed that Apple's new measures effectively block his software's ability to access iCloud content.\n\nDespite these improvements, concerns remain about the security of the recovery key, as it is difficult to remember and could be stolen or lost, potentially locking users out of their accounts.

His service in the Vietnam War as a naval hospital orderly during the Tet Offensive inspired him to pursue medicine and value time urgently.

Frustrated with the slow pace of traditional methods, he adopted an automated decoding machine and then focused on the active parts of the genome, using RNA as a shortcut to rapidly produce gene sequences.\n\nVenter's approach was controversial; James Watson criticized his work, and Venter left the NIH to establish his own research institute.

Angelina Jolie, a BRCA1 carrier, underwent an oophorectomy in March and a double mastectomy two years prior to reduce her cancer risk.\n3. The study, conducted in Canada, analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and found that those who had an oophorectomy after diagnosis had a 77.4% 20-year survival rate, with a 62% reduction in breast cancer deaths for BRCA1 carriers.\n4. The protective effect of oophorectomy was immediate and lasted for 15 years, with a 73% reduction in death for BRCA1 carriers who had the surgery within two years of diagnosis.\n5. Oophorectomy also reduced the risk of death from all causes by 65% and prevented ovarian cancer deaths in the study group.\n6.

The case was revisited as part of a periodic review, leading to the exhumation of the baby's body and the eventual DNA match. Initially arrested on suspicion of infanticide, the charge was dropped when the mother explained the circumstances of the stillbirth. The baby was reburied at the same church where he was originally interred, and the mother remains on bail pending a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service on charges related to failing to register the birth and preventing a lawful burial. The investigation, which utilized advanced DNA techniques, brought closure to a long-standing mystery and evoked mixed emotions among the investigators, who expressed empathy for the mother's plight.

These fees provide insight into unexpectedly popular transport hubs among the rich and famous, including locations like Salzburg in Austria and Darwin in Australia. The private jet industry is lucrative, with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the U.S. and 705,000 in Europe, and is valued at $16.7 trillion in the U.S. and $15.8 trillion in Europe. Demand surges during major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and the Monaco Grand Prix, leading to higher costs for private jet travel.\n\nPrivate jet companies have quoted high prices for travel to such events, with round-trip costs from New York to the Super Bowl reaching around $38,000 to $54,000. For the Monaco Grand Prix, flights from London to Cannes or Nice are estimated at about \u00a38,835 to \u00a38,895.\n\nThe passage also lists the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the 767-400 aircraft, which is often used for private travel. The top three most expensive airports are all in Japan: Haneda Airport charges \u00a34,559, Narita International Airport charges \u00a33,728, and Kansai International Airport charges \u00a33,594. Other airports in the top 10 for high landing fees include Toronto Pearson International Airport, Darwin International Airport, Bristol Airport, and La Guardia Airport in New York. Dublin Airport and Salzburg Airport also feature on the list, with Dublin in eighth place and Salzburg in tenth.

This test helps to assess the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery, potentially sparing some patients from chemotherapy. Women can learn within days if their risk of recurrence is low, possibly as low as five percent, which is comparable to or better than the odds after chemotherapy. Traditionally, most breast cancer patients undergo chemotherapy to prevent recurrence despite its harsh side effects, which include hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. However, experts believe that chemotherapy may not be necessary for all patients, as the risk of recurrence varies. The EndoPredict test can inform patients' decisions about whether to proceed with chemotherapy. Currently, these tests are primarily available privately for about \u00a32,500, but there is hope that they will soon be incorporated into the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Surgeon Hemant Singhal and Professor Kefah Mokbel support the use of this test in the NHS, arguing that the cost is justified by the potential savings from avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy. Rebecca Cornford, a patient who faced the prospect of chemotherapy after a second breast cancer diagnosis, opted out of chemotherapy after her tumor received a low EndoPredict score, indicating a 95% chance of remaining cancer-free for ten years without chemotherapy. She emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring and the potential to catch any recurrence early.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Heavy drinking rose by 17.2%, with the increase largely attributed to changing social norms and rising rates among women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men over the past month, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month.\n\nNationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men. In Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared with 23% among men. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. However, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged.\n\nThe study, which is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, also highlighted geographic disparities, with Madison County, Idaho, reporting the lowest rate of binge drinking at 6%, and Menominee, Wisconsin, having the highest rate at 36%. Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers, while Esmeralda County, Nevada, recorded the most.\n\nExcessive drinking is associated with significant public health issues, with about 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and an estimated annual cost of over $220 billion. Public health experts suggest that cultural and economic factors, including changed social norms allowing women to drink similarly to men, the influence of affluent young professionals in cities like San Francisco and San Jose, and the decreased real cost of alcohol due to stable taxes, contribute to the increase in excessive drinking. Additionally, increased alcohol advertising and weakened alcohol control policies may also play a role.\n\nThe study's data came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

Despite a strong start to the season, which saw him on track to break the Premier League record for assists, his form has dipped significantly. This was evident in his recent subpar performance for Spain against Holland, where he was rated poorly by Spanish media.\n\nFabregas, who expressed happiness at playing regularly for Chelsea, has been feeling the effects of a long and intense season. His recent statistics reflect this slump; after amassing 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has only managed one assist in his last five games for Chelsea and none in his international appearance. This trend aligns with the comments made by his former club Barcelona, which noted his tendency to start seasons strongly but fade as they progress.\n\nDespite this, Fabregas has the opportunity to turn things around, as Chelsea faces six teams he has previously provided assists against this season. With nine games left, his resurgence could be crucial in securing the Premier League title for Chelsea, and his recent assist for Diego Costa against Hull City may signal a return to form. Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's manager, is counting on Fabregas to regain his early-season impact and help clinch the title in the coming weeks.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The wide leg trouser is a key trend for the Spring/Summer 2015 season, appearing in various styles such as denim, cropped, printed, and striped.\n2. This trend offers an alternative to the skinny jean, which has been popular for several years, providing a fresh look while skinny jeans remain a staple.\n3. The wide leg trouser has made a comeback since the 1970s and has been previously embraced by celebrities like Lou, who wore Stella McCartney flared jeans seven years prior.\n4. Styling wide leg trousers can be challenging, especially for those with a shorter stature. The solution is to wear high heels and keep the top half simple to avoid being overwhelmed by fabric.\n5. For those opting for a cropped wide leg trouser, a high heeled shoe with an exposed top of the foot is recommended to elongate the leg.\n6. Proportion is crucial; pairing wide-leg trousers with a simple knit, shirt, or tee keeps the look modern and balanced.\n7. Denim is suggested as the easiest way to adopt the wide leg trouser trend, with Gucci's SS15 runway showcasing flared jeans in vintage washes and Topshop offering a high street version called the Miller jean.\n8. Other designers like Celine presented colorful, billowing trousers, while Stella McCartney and new online label Finery London offered dressier versions suitable for evening wear.\n9. The wide leg trouser silhouette is a seasonal update for one's wardrobe and has the advantage of being wearable regardless of weather conditions.\n10.

The situation is more pronounced among women, with three-quarters never washing their own car. Instead, drivers are increasingly using car washes on local forecourts.\n\nThe reasons for this shift include the opening of shops on Sundays, more live football on TV, and the rise of hand car washes. Additionally, the size of modern 4x4 and off-road vehicles makes them difficult for owners to clean. However, during holidays like Easter, an estimated 15 million cars are washed by their owners, with one in four people doing it as an excuse to leave the house.\n\nGeographically, cars are most frequently washed by their owners in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least often in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. The types of cars washed most often by their owners are Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are washed the least.\n\nAndrew Kirkley of OSV notes that the decline in personal car washing is due to a combination of factors, including time constraints, larger vehicles, and a lack of interest from children in earning money by washing cars.

This has left three generations of WPRs in abject poverty.\n\nThe recent success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in winning a share of power in Kashmir has sparked hope among the WPRs. The BJP is expected to advocate for the refugees' cause, potentially leading to the normalization of their status and the granting of state-subject rights, which would significantly improve their living conditions.\n\nThe WPRs' situation is complicated by the special autonomy of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, and the ongoing conflict with Pakistan over the territory. Successive state governments have been reluctant to grant full rights to the WPRs, fearing it would upset the demographic balance between the Muslim and Hindu populations. The WPRs are not recognized as citizens due to a pre-independence law that limits citizenship to those born in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir and their descendants.\n\nDespite Kashmir's relative prosperity, the WPRs live in poverty, with limited opportunities for education and employment.

The map, which covers 0.4% of the sky and shows clumps of dark matter particles, was produced by researchers from the University of Manchester led by Dr. Sarah Bridle. It was constructed over two years by measuring the shapes of galaxies using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel device mounted on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile.\n\nDark matter, which constitutes at least 80-85% of the universe's matter, is invisible but its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation of galaxies. The map was released at the American Physical Society meeting and reveals the distribution of dark matter by observing its gravitational lensing effect on light from distant galaxies.

'Snooze' by Instruments, an alarm clock that connects to your phone to silence notifications for a better night's sleep.\n2. 'Forget Me Lock' by Onn Studio, a key attachment that indicates whether the door is locked (red) or unlocked (green).\n3. 'Nipper' by Impulse, claimed to be the world's smallest mobile phone charger, which uses any household battery to charge a phone.\n\nThe public can vote for their favorite product by retweeting tweets with the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will proceed to a Kickstarter campaign for funding and development. The competition showcases the innovative solutions developed by British designers to solve everyday problems. Other product ideas that did not make the final shortlist included a helmet with bone conduction headphones for safe cycling navigation, a parking pin to alert drivers to available parking spaces, and the 'Relay' app to nominate message recipients when a phone's battery dies.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "WizardLM-2-8x22B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
