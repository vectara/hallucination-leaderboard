The researchers suggest that antibiotics may be contributing to the obesity epidemic, similar to how they are used to make farm animals gain weight. The study found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by the age of two, and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. The study did not prove that antibiotics caused weight gain, but it did suggest that killing certain gut bugs may increase appetite and free up more food for the body. The lead author of the study warned that the overuse of antibiotics could be an additional factor in the development of excess weight problems. Previous research has also found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The passage highlights growing concerns about the over-prescription of antibiotics and the potential consequences, such as the development of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.", "company": "microsoft", "model_name": "phi-2", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showedered, according to the Pottstown Mercury.

Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first.

The plan involves nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs, but unions warn against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. The report highlights examples of areas already experimenting with reshaping the workforce, including covering for doctor shortages and providing more rewarding roles for staff. However, the Nuffield Trust admits that money will need to be set aside to ensure it happens. The report author Candace Imison says there are \"huge opportunities\" in reshaping the workforce to improve patient care and provide staff with more rewarding roles. NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer agrees and says the challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report. However, British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter warns that increasing the skills of the workforce should not come at the expense of good quality training for doctors. He says there is no substitute for the expertise and experience of doctors, and that there should be more staff support for doctors to coordinate the best possible care for their patients. Unison head of health Christina McAnea says the squeeze on funding in the health service means there is often no funding for training courses.

The woman, Elena Curtin, was seven months pregnant when she was charged with second-degree assault in November 2014. She was set to go to trial in Multnomah County Circuit Court, but prosecutors dropped the charge on Monday, stating that Curtin was justified in her outrage. Curtin gave birth in January and found her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin in her bathroom. When she asked her to leave, the woman refused, and Curtin beat her with a crowbar. Oregon law allows for the use of physical force against an intruder who won't leave a resident's home. Curtin's defense attorney, Casey Kovacic, said the ex-girlfriend was jealous and bitter that the boyfriend was in a relationship with his client. The boyfriend struggled with heroin in the past, and the ex and boyfriend had gotten high at the apartment before. They have since reconciled, and Curtin is now living with her parents. The boyfriend has not been a part of his new child's life. Kovacic wrote that the ex-girlfriend made it her personal mission to make Elena's life miserable, harassing and threatening to hurt her, stealing from her, and plotting to drag the boyfriend back into addiction. The ex-girlfriend's actions were one silver lining, as Elena was able to examine how bad her relationship was and move on with her life.
