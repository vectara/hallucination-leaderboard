The research, tracking 4,300 young people since 1998, identifies a history of police trouble as the strongest predictor of being not in education, employment, or training by age 18, and notes that extreme poverty heightens the chances of being both victims and perpetrators of crime, even after accounting for factors like truancy and substance abuse. Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violence, while girls from poor households are twice as likely as affluent ones. Prof Lesley McAra highlights how poverty and justice system contact create a cycle that fosters violence.

Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women or two for men in the past month, while binge drinking involves four or more drinks for women or five for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, though the overall percentage of people drinking any alcohol remained stable. The study, the first to track patterns at the county level, highlighted variations such as Madison County, Idaho, with the lowest binge rate (6%) and Menominee, Wisconsin, with the highest (36%). Factors contributing to the rise include changing social norms allowing women to drink more like men, higher rates among young and affluent people, cheaper alcohol due to stagnant taxes, increased advertising, and weakened control policies.
