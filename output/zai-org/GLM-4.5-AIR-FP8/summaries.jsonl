The multi-university team found these ditched enclosures are unlikely villages or defensive structures due to few artifacts and non-defensive layouts, suggesting they were sporadically used ritual gathering places, though their purpose remains unclear. Dr Loader's analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon isotopes indicates the geoglyphs were constructed among taller vegetation, making them likely invisible above the forest canopy, unlike other ritual sites. This research challenges the notion of pristine pre-European Amazonian forests, revealing evidence of human influence over 6,000 years where people concentrated on economically valuable trees like palms instead of large-scale burning, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products, with tantalizing evidence that some remaining forests retain a legacy of these ancient agroforestry practices.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.5-AIR-FP8","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-06","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The National Security Agency (NSA) accessed vast amounts of individual data including chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers, and social networking information, and confirmed requesting millions of phone records from Verizon, including call duration, location, and numbers. Documents revealed the Prism program enabled \"backdoor\" access to servers of nine major tech companies (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple) for private posts, chats, and searches, though all companies denied involvement and the program's mechanics remain unclear. NSA Director Keith Alexander defended the operations as essential for security, citing the need to protect methods from terrorists, while experts like Peter Sommer suggested access might be more limited, akin to a \"catflap\" requiring court orders. Data protection laws vary by country but typically regulate company practices rather than government activity, and company privacy policies often include clauses allowing information sharing when legally obliged. User data is frequently stored outside the user's country (e.g., in the US via cloud computing), subject to US laws like the Patriot Act and FISA, which allow authorities easy access to non-US data with little transparency. UK Foreign Secretary Hague refused to confirm British involvement via GCHQ, and the EU expressed concern and sought details. Hague stated law-abiding citizens need not worry, but Privacy International warned that using major US-based services risks privacy violations under Prism, with Snowden stating he acted to avoid living in a society where everything is recorded.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.5-AIR-FP8","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-06","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The study, tracking county-level data, found significant variations, with Madison County, Idaho reporting the lowest binge drinking rate (6%) and Menominee, Wisconsin the highest (36%).
