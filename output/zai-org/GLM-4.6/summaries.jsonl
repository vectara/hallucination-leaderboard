The research on over 12,000 children indicated that repeated antibiotic prescriptions before age two also increased the odds of being overweight, with boys being particularly prone to the effect. While the study did not prove causation, researchers hypothesize that antibiotics may alter gut bacteria, freeing up more calories for the body or increasing appetite. The findings suggest that early antibiotic exposure could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.6","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

While boys are three times more likely to be violent than girls, girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime. The study concludes that contact with the juvenile justice system can inadvertently worsen the conditions that lead to violence.

The sites were revealed by modern deforestation and their function is not well understood; they were likely not villages or defensive structures, but possibly used as sporadic ritual gathering places. Soil analysis suggests the geoglyphs were built among tall vegetation and were not visible above the forest canopy, which raises questions about their purpose. The research challenges the assumption that the Amazon was pristine before European arrival, indicating that for 6,000 years humans created a \"prehistoric supermarket\" by cultivating useful trees rather than burning large forest areas. This ancient agroforestry may have left a lasting legacy on the biodiversity of some of Acre's remaining forests.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.6","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

War.\" The report compiles known facts to accuse President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Contradicting Russia's official denial, the report alleges that Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive in securing major rebel victories, with Russian generals directing the main battles. Evidence includes testimony from soldiers, documentation of military units, and financial details such as soldier salaries and a total conflict cost of 53bn roubles. The report's origins lie in Nemtsov's investigation into unpaid compensation for families of dead Russian soldiers, who are now too scared to speak publicly after his assassination. While the opposition accuses Putin of orchestrating the war to boost his popularity, they acknowledge he was successful in this aim. Publishing the report is challenging, and it may face the same fate as previous works by Nemtsov, which, despite praise from critics, failed to galvanize protests, partly because many Russians find the country's involvement acceptable.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.6","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Consequently, half of the parents reported their children asked for these new foods to be made at home. The most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, whereas aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. The School Food Trust commissioned this research after a Mumsnet survey suggested some parents avoided school lunches, believing their children were too fussy. According to experts, school meals help children try new things, and positive peer pressure at school encourages them to eat a wider variety of foods. School meals in England must now adhere to strict nutritional guidelines, with about four in 10 primary school children eating them.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.6","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

A typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. A leading expert, Professor David Spiegelhalter, suggests that smartphone and internet use may be to blame. He theorizes that constant connectivity erodes the boundaries between work and private life, leaving less \"quiet time\" for couples. As a result, with competing demands on their time, sex becomes a lower priority, and people may be too connected to the outside world by bedtime to focus on their partner.","company":"zai-org","model_name":"GLM-4.6","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}
