Researchers suggest that antibiotics, similar to their use in farm animals, may contribute to weight gain in children. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, indicates that these drugs could be a factor in the childhood obesity epidemic. In England, a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds are overweight or obese. The Finnish study compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records, finding that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as babies were more likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two further increasing the odds. Boys showed a higher propensity for weight gain after antibiotic use and were slightly taller. The study did not prove causation but suggested that antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that increased antibiotic use could contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic use to higher risks of eczema and digestive problems. There is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of superbugs.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime compared to those from more affluent households. A history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of a young person not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Household poverty exacerbates the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered.

Once a dominant force with 182 grand prix wins, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles, McLaren now aims for the fourth row of the grid and decent points. The team's decline began in 2013 with chassis design issues and has continued with problems related to the Honda power-unit. Despite this, McLaren has a history of cyclical triumph and decline, with periods of dominance followed by dips in form. Notable eras include partnerships with Honda and Mercedes, and drivers like Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, and Mika Hakkinen. Recent scandals and the departure of key drivers have further impacted their performance. Ron Dennis, who has been instrumental in the team's history, believes success will return, especially with Fernando Alonso's return in 2015. The team's future hinges on their ability to overcome current challenges and regain their former glory.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Mangu Ram, an 82-year-old Hindu traditional healer, fled to Kashmir as a refugee at age 14 and has since been unable to own property or vote in state elections. Around 100,000 WPRs, most living in the Jammu region, face similar issues due to a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to those born in the old undivided kingdom of Kashmir. This has trapped three generations in poverty. The reluctance of state governments to grant full rights to these predominantly Hindu refugees is attributed to fears of upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. However, with the recent success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party in a state vote, there is hope that the WPRs' status may be normalized. Activist Labha Ram Gandhi emphasizes the need for state-subject rights to improve their condition, warning that the community is prepared to fight for their rights if necessary.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that the number of times Britons are having sex has been decreasing since the advent of the internet. According to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the integration of public and private lives due to constant connectivity, such as checking emails, which reduces quiet, empty time. He also notes that more people living alone and the erosion of boundaries between home, work, and the outside world contribute to this trend. Catherine Mercer, a researcher, adds that competing demands on time and staying connected late into the evening make sex a lower priority.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Once highly prized and commanding prices up to \u00a31.2 million, these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses due to a combination of factors. The Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown has reduced the practice of using mastiffs as gifts to influence officials. Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in major cities have impacted their popularity. The breed's over-commercialization, including cross-breeding for profit, has led to a glut of poor-quality dogs. Urbanization has also made people realize that Tibetan mastiffs are not well-suited to city living. Animal welfare workers have rescued mastiffs bound for slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in hotpots and their skin for leather belts.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

They conducted a survey of 2,000 people to identify the top ten everyday emergencies, with the top issue being difficulty sleeping (46%). Design groups, including Makerversity, were tasked with creating products to alleviate these problems. Three prototypes were shortlisted: \n\n1. **Snooze** by Instruments: An alarm clock that connects to your phone and silences notifications to ensure a good night's sleep.\n2. **Forget Me Lock** by Onn Studio: A device that fastens on a key, swiveling green when the door is open and red when locked, providing reassurance about door security.\n3. **Nipper** by Impulse: The world's smallest mobile phone charger, which uses any household battery to provide a boost.\n\nThe public can vote for their favorite prototype on Twitter using the #everydayfix hashtag. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will be funded through a Kickstarter campaign and developed into an actual product. Other prototypes that didn't make the final shortlist include a parking pin, a relay app for message forwarding when the phone dies, and a smart helmet with bone conduction headphones for cyclists.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-pro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
