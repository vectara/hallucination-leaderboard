The study, published in Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as young babies being particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before age two also increased the odds. Boys seemed more prone to this weight gain and were also slightly taller than boys who had not been given the drugs. While the study doesn't prove causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might kill gut bugs that normally consume some food, freeing up more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The lead author warned that this effect could play a role in the childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy."}

Tracked by scientists from Oregon State University, Varvara traveled from her feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island, across the Pacific Ocean, and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. This journey surpassed the previous record held by a humpback whale. The trip suggests that Varvara, previously thought to be an endangered western gray whale, might actually be an eastern gray whale, as she visited three major breeding areas for that population. This finding could mean the number of western gray whales, estimated at only 150, might be even lower."}

A key challenge is that the UK exports most of its fish to the EU and imports a significant amount of the fish it consumes from the EU. Therefore, continued access to the EU market is crucial, but this may require allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters as a trade-off.

These events, along with a bloodless military takeover in 2006, harmed Fiji's economy, particularly tourism, and its international reputation, leading to its suspension from the Commonwealth in 2009.

The problem was long waiting times for diagnosis, particularly for patients with vague or difficult-to-diagnose symptoms.\n\nThe new Danish model has three routes for patients:\n1.  A fast-track route for patients with \"alarm\" symptoms of specific cancers.\n2.  Diagnostic centres for patients with symptoms that GPs cannot diagnose, where they receive a range of tests and scans quickly.\n3.  \"Yes-no\" centres for patients with minor symptoms, offering a simple test or scan to quickly rule out or identify serious disease.\n\nAccording to Professor Frede Olesen, these changes have led to better organization, improved cancer survival rates, and have helped Denmark catch up with other Scandinavian countries without \"flooding the system\" with more GP referrals."}

Their place has been taken by Chester, the team Hereford had sent down on the final day of the season. The Conference had extended a payment deadline for Hereford three times, with the final deadline being Thursday, 12 June. The club's debt to football creditors, including former manager Martin Foyle and current players, amounted to Â£148,000. Despite a recent takeover by London businessman Tommy Agombar, the club failed to meet the deadline. The club also faced debts of approximately Â£225,000 at the end of the season and still owes over Â£70,000 in taxes to HMRC. An offer from the Hereford United Supporters' Trust to buy the club for Â£1 and clear its debts was not the preferred option for chairman David Keyte. The club's financial problems have been worsened by falling attendance, which dropped to an average of 1,758 in the 2013-14 season."}

This rise is largely driven by women's drinking habits, with the rate of binge drinking among women increasing more than seven times the rate among men nationwide over the decade. In 2012, 8 percent of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. The study, which was the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, also noted that while excessive drinking increased, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol remained relatively unchanged. Public health experts attribute the increase to factors such as changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink, cheaper alcohol prices in real dollars, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies."}

This bias is described as both overt, such as the lack of women on corporate boards, and covert, like how female professors are rated differently than male ones. The passage concludes that gender equality benefits everyoneâcompanies, children, and marriagesâand that overcoming this bias is a steeper challenge for female candidates like Clinton.

It is the first in a series of maps from the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), which aims to eventually map 12.5 percent of the sky to create a 3D view of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is an invisible substance that makes up at least 80 percent of the matter in the universe. It cannot be observed directly, so the survey studies its gravitational effects on galaxies, a technique called gravitational lensing. The map was created by analyzing 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies. The findings so far support theories that galaxies form where there are large concentrations of dark matter. The ultimate goal of the survey is to understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate."}

In his book, \"Sex by Numbers,\" Spiegelhalter reveals that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. He suggests that because people are now better connected technologically and are always checking emails, the boundaries between public and private lives have eroded, squeezing out time that would have been spent with partners. Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, is quoted as saying that with competing demands on time, sex falls down the list of priorities, and dealing with work emails late in the evening can prevent people from focusing on their partners at bedtime."}

Their popularity has dramatically declined, and they are now being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat and skin. This decline is attributed to several factors: the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has stopped the practice of giving the dogs as gifts; bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several major cities; and a realization that the breed is not suited for city living. The market collapse was highlighted when animal-welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs from a truck heading to a slaughterhouse. Additionally, a glut of poor-quality dogs exists due to cross-breeding by breeders seeking profits."}
