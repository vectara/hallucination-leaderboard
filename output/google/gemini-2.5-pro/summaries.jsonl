The study, published in Pediatrics, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with their antibiotic prescription records. By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with those who had taken antibiotics as young babies being particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before age two also increased the odds. Boys seemed more prone to this weight gain and were also slightly taller than boys who had not been given the drugs. While the study doesn't prove causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might kill gut bugs that normally consume some food, freeing up more for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The lead author warned that this effect could play a role in the childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy."}

Tracked by scientists from Oregon State University, Varvara traveled from her feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island, across the Pacific Ocean, and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. This journey surpassed the previous record held by a humpback whale. The trip suggests that Varvara, previously thought to be an endangered western gray whale, might actually be an eastern gray whale, as she visited three major breeding areas for that population. This finding could mean the number of western gray whales, estimated at only 150, might be even lower."}

The report notes that while Brexit offers the chance to regain control over UK waters, the industry's small contribution to GDP (half of one percent) and workforce (12,000 fishers) might make it a low government priority. A key challenge is that the UK exports most of its fish to the EU and imports a significant amount of the fish it consumes from the EU. Therefore, continued access to the EU market is crucial, but this may require allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters as a trade-off. The report also suggests retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), like basing quotas on scientific advice, and highlights the UK's international obligation to cooperate with neighbouring states. A potential complication is that leaving the CFP framework could lead to four different fisheries management systems within the UK.

A 1987 coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew an Indian-dominated coalition. Another coup in 2000, led by George Speight, saw the ethnic Indian prime minister taken hostage. These events, along with a bloodless military takeover in 2006, harmed Fiji's economy, particularly tourism, and its international reputation, leading to its suspension from the Commonwealth in 2009. After holding free elections in 2014, Fiji was reinstated. The population is divided between indigenous Fijians, who are now the majority, and Indo-Fijians, with minimal mixing between the groups. The economy relies on sugar and tourism but is diverse, including mining and a strong services sector. However, it has been hampered by trade and budget deficits, making it a large recipient of aid."}

This is a frequent accusation against the star. When questioned by a TV reporter about his own rent while supporting a housing campaign, Brand called the journalist \"a snide\" and walked off. He has also been tweeting about The Sun's accusations using the hashtag #TheSunLogic.\n\nIn the past, Brand has addressed the hypocrisy charge by acknowledging his wealth and fame, stating he knows they are not the answer and that he, like everyone, needs to change. He believes in personal change, including sharing wealth, but sees it as a \"sweet, futile gesture\" without systemic change. He admits to doing \"daft things\" and calls himself a \"right twerp,\" but argues that his personal flaws do not detract from the reality of economic disparity and ecological disaster. He suggests that the accusations of hypocrisy are a way to avoid discussing the real issue of inequality."}

The drone, which was 50 centimeters wide, also had a small camera, smoke flares, and a plastic bottle. The amount of radioactive material was not immediately harmful to humans. This discovery has raised concerns in Japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones, especially with the upcoming Olympics and G7 summit. The incident occurred on the same day a court approved the restart of two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant. Currently, Japanese law does not restrict drone flights over most of Tokyo, including the Prime Minister's residence."}

This rise is largely driven by women's drinking habits, with the rate of binge drinking among women increasing more than seven times the rate among men nationwide over the decade. In 2012, 8 percent of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. The study, which was the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, also noted that while excessive drinking increased, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol remained relatively unchanged. Public health experts attribute the increase to factors such as changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink, cheaper alcohol prices in real dollars, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies."}

The passage counters this by pointing out that male hormones have historically impaired male leaders' decision-making, and studies show women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks. The author argues that the debate over hormones is a symptom of a larger, more serious issue: gender bias against women in the workplace and leadership roles. This bias is described as both overt, such as the lack of women on corporate boards, and covert, like how female professors are rated differently than male ones. The passage concludes that gender equality benefits everyone—companies, children, and marriages—and that overcoming this bias is a steeper challenge for female candidates like Clinton. It also notes that Rios, who threatened to move to Canada if a woman were elected, was seemingly unaware that Canada had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993."}

This status is due to a pre-independence law and has trapped generations in poverty.

This belief motivates her burlesque performances, where she exposes audiences to a 'fat' body in a positive way. Since starting in 2012, performing has been an empowering and body-positive experience for her. Her 2014 TED Talk, recently posted on YouTube, has received a mostly positive response."}

It is the first in a series of maps from the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), which aims to eventually map 12.5 percent of the sky to create a 3D view of dark matter.\n\nDark matter is an invisible substance that makes up at least 80 percent of the matter in the universe. It cannot be observed directly, so the survey studies its gravitational effects on galaxies, a technique called gravitational lensing. The map was created by analyzing 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies. The findings so far support theories that galaxies form where there are large concentrations of dark matter. The ultimate goal of the survey is to understand the nature of dark energy, which is believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate."}

Their popularity has dramatically declined, and they are now being sent to slaughterhouses for their meat and skin. This decline is attributed to several factors: the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has stopped the practice of giving the dogs as gifts; bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several major cities; and a realization that the breed is not suited for city living. The market collapse was highlighted when animal-welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs from a truck heading to a slaughterhouse. Additionally, a glut of poor-quality dogs exists due to cross-breeding by breeders seeking profits."}
