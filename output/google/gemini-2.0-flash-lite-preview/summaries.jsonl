The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved. The report says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three. The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany. The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\"", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview", "date_code": "02-05", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
