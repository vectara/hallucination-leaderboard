Published in Pediatrics, the research compared over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, revealing that children who received antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before age two also increasing this likelihood, especially for boys. While not proving causation, researchers propose that antibiotics might kill gut bugs, freeing up more food for the body or increasing appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasized that early or repeated antibiotic exposure is associated with increased body mass in healthy children, underscoring the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy due to its potential role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

The Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime found that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action and are five times more likely to be on statutory supervision than better-off children, with poverty increasing the likelihood of violence and offending, and being the strongest predictor of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. It also noted boys are three times more likely to be violent, and poorer girls are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime. A separate study by AQMeN Research Centre revealed that despite an overall fall in Scottish crime rates, the most deprived communities continue to experience the highest crime, with high-crime areas also showing high rates of chronic health problems and unemployment. Researchers suggest that contact with the justice system may inadvertently perpetuate violence and question if inequality is being adequately addressed. The Scottish government, however, states Scotland is becoming safer with crime at a 41-year low and outlines its efforts to tackle poverty and inequalities through initiatives like a £296m investment.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing, was involved in a collision with Felipe Nasr, made five pit stops, and his car sustained significant damage, impacting its aerodynamic performance. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel finished second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap, with Raikkonen recovering to fifth place, passing Hamilton in the closing stages due to a soft tyre strategy. Daniil Kvyat finished on the podium after an aggressive move that led to a confrontation with Vettel. Daniel Ricciardo initially took the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg but suffered a puncture, allowing Rosberg to take a commanding lead and win the race. Hamilton now faces a 36-point deficit to Rosberg, who has won the first three races of the season, a historical precursor to claiming the World Championship.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

The research also challenges the idea of pristine Amazonian forests before European arrival, suggesting humans artificially cultivated diverse plant species over 6,000 years by concentrating on economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket,\" and that some current forest biodiversity may be a legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

Although most landlords cooperate, a small minority resist, leading the council to prosecute one firm and 13 individuals so far.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

A record 46.8 million people registered for the 8 June election, with a 68.7% turnout, but a significant proportion, estimated between 30% and 70%, of the 4.9 million applications submitted between December 2016 and May 2017 were likely duplicates. This problem arises from the \"dispersed and unconnected\" nature of Britain's 381 electoral registers and the lack of direct communication between these and the online registration service, leading to administrative and financial burdens. The watchdog recommends better joined-up electoral registers, clearer information on registration sites including a potential verification function, and for people registered in two seats to choose one in advance for future general elections.

The report, largely based on existing media facts, presents evidence that Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive in rebel victories, with Russian generals directing battles and volunteer soldiers receiving $2,000-3,000 monthly. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles. Nemtsov began the report after hearing about uncompensated relatives of dead Russian soldiers, who are now fearful. The opposition faces difficulties in publishing and distributing the report due to fear, and while many Russians are aware of the conflict, they often find it acceptable, believing Moscow supports those seeking independence from Kiev. The opposition, however, believes Putin masterminded the war to boost his popularity, a goal they admit he achieved, and they acknowledge that this report may share the fate of Nemtsov's previous works, which failed to galvanize protests.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

He included humorous remarks about facing competition from the Chancellor's budget and the Cheltenham racecourse, and concluded by stating there is no greater honour than to be an MSP. Duncan McNeil, who served since 1999, warned in his final speech that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly regarding the committee system, to ensure accountability, scrutiny, and opposition. Annabel Goldie joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

A study indicated that this procedure cuts the risk of dying from breast cancer by over 60% for BRCA1 mutation carriers, though not for BRCA2 carriers. Angelina Jolie had this procedure after a double mastectomy due to her BRCA1 gene variant, which dramatically raises the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. The Canadian study, which analyzed 676 breast cancer patients with mutated genes, found a 62% drop in breast cancer death for BRCA1 carriers who had an oophorectomy, and a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The protective effect was apparent immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years, with a 73% reduction in death for BRCA1 carriers who had the procedure within two years of diagnosis. Experts suggest oophorectomy should be part of treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers with early-stage breast cancers, particularly for BRCA1 carriers, as it offers both disease-free and overall survival benefits, especially for women with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}

After surgery, cancer cells are screened to assess the risk of recurrence, with some women showing a risk as low as five percent, comparable to or better than chemotherapy. While most women routinely receive chemotherapy after tumour removal to prevent recurrence, despite severe side effects, experts believe it may not be necessary for all. Tests like Endopredict allow patients with a low score to opt out of chemotherapy. These tests are mostly private, costing around £2,500, but specialists hope for NHS availability due to potential savings.

Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking is four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. In 2012, 8 percent of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. This increase is attributed to changed social norms, making it more acceptable for women to drink, along with alcohol becoming cheaper, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. Alcohol was linked to 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and an estimated cost of over $220 billion annually.

It comes in various styles, including denim, cropped, printed, or striped. To wear them successfully, especially for shorter individuals, the key is the shoe: high heels, particularly those with an exposed top of the foot, help elongate the leg. It's also recommended to keep the top half simple with a knit, shirt, or tee to maintain proportion and avoid being overwhelmed by fabric. For longer lengths, a high-waisted and very long style can give extra leg length. Denim is considered the easiest way to embrace the trend, with designers like Gucci showcasing flared jeans, while Celine and Stella McCartney offered dressier styles.

The couple's attorney states they primarily seek an apology from Evans, with mediation scheduled and a trial set for July if no agreement is reached.

This problem limits women's freedom, forcing them to alter their daily lives and effectively \"excludes women from the public arena.\" The findings prompted calls for a campaign to address sexist or threatening behavior on buses and trains, emphasizing the need to educate women that such experiences are not normal and to inform aggressors and witnesses about the legal consequences of sexual assault.","company":"google","model_name":"gemini-2.5-flash","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-03","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","thinking_budget":-1}
