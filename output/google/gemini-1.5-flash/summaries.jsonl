The researchers believe that antibiotics may be killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, leading to more food being available for the body. They also suggest that killing certain gut bugs may increase appetite. The study highlights the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy, as overuse could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic.", "company": "google", "model_name": "gemini-1.5-flash", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month. The study found that women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% between 2002 and 2012, compared with 23% among men. Nationwide, the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level.

The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The DES is a five-year project that aims to map 12.5% of the sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter and dark energy. The map shows clumps of dark matter, with red indicating more dark matter and blue indicating less. The researchers used gravitational lensing to study the distortion of light around distant galaxies caused by the gravitational pull of dark matter. The map shows large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside.
