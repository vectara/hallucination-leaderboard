Secondly, the defense remains a weakness despite significant investment, with no clear leader emerging. Lastly, while Gerrard remains a key player, his age is becoming a factor, and the team needs to find ways to compensate for his declining physical abilities. Savage predicts a challenging match against Chelsea, who are currently performing at a much higher level.

Some believe women are unfit to be president due to their hormones, using the justification that men like George W. Bush have started wars due to their testosterone.

This bias against women is detrimental to society, as equality benefits everyone. Companies with more women in leadership roles make more money, children with involved fathers are happier and healthier, couples who share responsibilities have stronger marriages, and diverse teams produce better results.
