The street, which was home to the nation's biggest newspapers for decades, has a rich history dating back to 1702 when the first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published. At its height, Fleet Street was a bustling hub of journalism, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices in the area. However, with the advent of new technology and the relocation of newspapers to other parts of London, the street's importance began to decline. The final blow came in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to a new complex in Wapping, leading to a bitter dispute and the eventual defeat of the unions. Today, the buildings that once housed newspapers have been repurposed, and the era of Fleet Street as a journalistic hub has come to an end.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were built amongst taller vegetation, unlike other ritual sites around the world. The research also indicates that the Amazonian forests were not pristine ecosystems before the arrival of Europeans, but were instead transformed by humans through \"agroforestry\" practices, which concentrated on economically valuable trees such as palms.
