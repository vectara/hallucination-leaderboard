The research indicates that humans transformed their environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees such as palms, creating a form of \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.

The UK's defense spending has been cut significantly, and its military capabilities have been reduced, including the size of its regular army, the number of warships, and the number of front-line fast jet squadrons. The UK is also set to fall below the NATO threshold for defense spending, which could negatively impact its credibility with the US. The article mentions that the UK's defense budget is set to be cut further, with the Conservatives planning to make savings of around \u00a312bn a year, and Labour avoiding making similar commitments. The article also discusses the debate around renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent, with the Conservatives and UKIP committed to a like-for-like replacement, while Labour would look at whether it can be done with three rather than four submarines, and the Liberal Democrats would end the continuous at-sea deterrent.
