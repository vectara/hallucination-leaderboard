CDC defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two for men; binge drinking as four or more for women and five or more for men in a single occasion. Women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times those of men nationwide. In 2012, 8% were heavy drinkers and 18% binge drinkers, though overall alcohol consumption rates remained stable. County data showed Madison County, Idaho, with the lowest binge rate (6%) and Menominee, Wisconsin, the highest (36%); Hancock County, Tennessee, had the fewest heavy drinkers (2%), Esmeralda County, Nevada, the most (22%). Alcohol-related deaths totaled 88,600 in 2010, costing over $220 billion annually. Contributing factors included changing social norms, affordability (alcohol cheaper in real terms), increased advertising ($3.45B in 2011), weakened alcohol policies, and affluent professionals in tech hubs.","company":"qwen","model_name":"qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","enable_thinking":true}

Rescuers found 20 dogs in cramped, inhumane conditions en route to a slaughterhouse, with many dead or injured, and fears hundreds face similar fates. The breed's market collapse follows a boom starting in 2005, where they were celebrated for loyalty and size (up to 80 kg), but now face neglect and cruelty.","company":"qwen","model_name":"qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","enable_thinking":true}
