The research suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by affecting the gut bacteria that normally help digest food, potentially leading to weight gain. The study, conducted by Finnish researchers, compared the weight and height of over 12,000 two-year-old children with records on antibiotic prescriptions. By two years old, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who had taken antibiotics as babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with repeated prescriptions before the age of two increasing the odds of being overweight. The study did not prove causation but highlighted the potential role of antibiotics in childhood obesity. The lead author warned about the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy. The study also noted that the obesity epidemic is more pronounced in boys, and there is growing concern about the over-prescription of antibiotics leading to antibiotic resistance.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The case highlights the financial and legal consequences of Sterling's controversial behavior, including his ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine. The gifts included luxury items and even mundane items like an Easter bunny costume and a blender.

Fleet Street was once a hub for newspapers, with many national and provincial publications having offices within a short distance. The area was known for its vibrant journalism culture, including a strong social scene and a history of journalistic tradition. The closure of the Sunday Post's London office symbolizes the end of an era, as the traditional print media industry declines. The passage also highlights the historical significance of Fleet Street, its role in the development of British journalism, and the transition to more modern forms of media. It mentions the decline of Fleet Street due to the move of major newspapers to other parts of London and the adoption of new technologies. The story concludes with a reflection on the legacy of Fleet Street and the ongoing impact of its history on the current media landscape.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

It found that children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action for the same crime as better-off children. Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with boys being three times more likely to engage in violent acts than girls. Poorer young people are also five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The study highlights a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risk of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system can exacerbate poverty. The findings were published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal, and the study tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998. The Scottish government claims Scotland is becoming a safer place to live, with crime at a 41-year low, but the study also shows that crime remains concentrated in the most deprived areas, raising questions about addressing inequality.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

He is best known for writing hits such as \"Off The Wall,\" \"Baby Be Mine,\" and \"Rock With You\" for Michael Jackson, as well as \"Boogie Nights\" for the band Heatwave. Temperton, nicknamed \"The Invisible Man,\" was influenced by his father's love for music, which started him listening to Radio Luxembourg as a child. He worked as a keyboardist for Heatwave in the 1970s, and his songs became hits for the band. His work with Quincy Jones led to his contributions to Michael Jackson's breakthrough albums Off The Wall and Thriller, which helped make Thriller the best-selling album of all time. Temperton also won a Grammy Award in 1990 and was nominated for two Oscars. He was celebrated for his songwriting philosophy of writing songs he loved first. Temperton's passing has been mourned by many in the music industry, including Michael Jackson's sister, Nile Rodgers, and Mark Ronson.

Southampton, who had a strong European game against Inter Milan, struggled to maintain their rhythm and were unable to equalize despite efforts from David Marshall, who made several crucial saves. The win was a significant boost for Hull, who remain in the bottom three heading into the international break.

Initially, the network will consist of at least 600 spacecraft, with the potential to expand to over 2,000. The goal is to provide broadband connections to every school globally. To achieve this, Airbus and OneWeb are implementing new, high-volume, low-cost satellite manufacturing methods, similar to car and plane factories, with plans to produce three units per shift at under a million dollars each. The project involves establishing assembly lines in Toulouse, France, and Florida, with the first satellites scheduled for launch in April 2021 and another batch in November. The constellation will require a significant rocket campaign, with over 20 Soyuz vehicles planned to launch the satellites. OneWeb also faces competition from other companies like SpaceX and Boeing, but believes it has a first-mover advantage. The project has raised $1.7 billion in equity and is seeking additional funding. OneWeb is based in the UK but must comply with UK Space Agency regulations.

He also stated that Scotland will defend and protect key priorities such as schools, hospitals, and the police service.

The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is seen as detrimental to the UK fishing industry, which helped drive the leave vote.

The House of Lords European Union Committee report notes that the fishing industry is a low priority for the government but must not be marginalized. The UK's fishing industry is complex due to shared fish stocks with EU coastal states and reliance on EU markets. The report suggests that the CFP should be retained post-Brexit, and the UK should continue to cooperate with neighboring states. There is a risk of four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland if the CFP framework falls away.

It highlights that fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum. The Lords review warns that these communities may be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been viewed as detrimental to the UK fishing industry, but Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. The report notes that the UK fishing industry is a low priority for the government but must not be marginalized. The industry faces challenges due to shared fish stocks with EU coastal states and the need for continued market access. The report suggests that post-Brexit, the UK should retain elements of the CFP and continue to cooperate with neighboring states. There is concern about the potential for four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Despite these challenges, the fishing industry remains optimistic about the future post-Brexit, with some analysts viewing the recent EU quota agreement as a positive sign.

The APC's victory signifies a historic shift, relegating the PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to gain national support, performing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most northern states and Lagos went to the APC, but the APC did not win any of the five oil-producing states, a concern for President-elect Buhari. The elections were generally peaceful, with some violence in southern states. The PDP is expected to undergo introspection and rebuilding under a new leader, as voters felt the need for change after 16 years of rule. The PDP also faced allegations of corruption and failure to address the Islamist insurgency in the north-east.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The app allows users to send messages securely and anonymously, and is particularly useful in situations with no connectivity, such as on planes or in the underground. Greenstone is currently under development and works with Firechat at a range of around 20ft (6m), holding up to 1,000 recent messages and having a one-year battery life. Open Garden is working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In a TED Talk, she shared that she identifies as 'short', 'wife', and 'fat', emphasizing that each term is a truthful description of herself. She argues that 'fat' does not have to be synonymous with 'ugly' and highlights the societal pressure on women to avoid the word. Despite this, she notes that size discrimination in the workplace has increased by 66% in the past 30 years, and young girls often desire to be thinner. However, she believes exposure to body diversity fosters acceptance and preference for different body types. Lillian's burlesque performances aim to challenge societal beauty standards and promote body positivity. She found empowerment through her performances and encourages others to find moments of courage to boost self-esteem. Her TED Talk, which was posted on YouTube three weeks ago, has received nearly 38,000 views and largely positive feedback, including messages from people who felt inspired to reevaluate their body image.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen3-4B", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
