FireChat, which launched last year and has been downloaded over five million times, utilizes Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF) to create a local network in which each phone becomes a node and data is passed between nodes. This allows users to send messages and photos even when there is no mobile or data signal. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way, at around 200 feet (61 meters). Greenstone has been designed to solve this issue by acting as a booster to help messages move more easily within these networks. The device is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20 feet (6 meters). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life and can hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone, and the timeframe for this will depend on these", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
