Boys appeared more susceptible to this effect and were slightly taller than those who hadn't received antibiotics.\n\nWhile the study didn't establish causation, researchers suggest antibiotics might contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally process food, leaving more calories available for absorption. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital emphasized that this effect could be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and stressed the importance of careful antibiotic use in infancy.\n\nThe findings are particularly relevant given current childhood obesity rates, with one-third of 10-11 year olds and over one-fifth of 4-5 year olds in England being overweight or obese.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Just a year ago, these dogs could sell for up to \u00a31.2 million each as status symbols. However, they are now being sent to slaughterhouses for meat and leather production. This decline is attributed to several factors:\n\n1. The Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown has stopped the practice of giving mastiffs as luxury gifts to officials\n2. Several Chinese cities have banned dogs weighing over 50kg\n3. Poor breeding practices have led to deteriorating quality\n4. Urbanization has made people realize these dogs aren't suitable for city living\n\nThe crisis was highlighted when animal welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs being transported to a slaughterhouse, with many dead or injured. The dogs are now being stolen from streets and sold to slaughterhouses, while breeders are disposing of \"imperfect\" specimens at abattoirs.", "company": "anthropic", "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet", "date_code": "20241022", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
