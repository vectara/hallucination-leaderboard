The research, published in Pediatrics, examined over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by age two. Children who received antibiotics as young babies, especially repeatedly before age two, had higher odds of being overweight, with boys particularly affected. \n\nThe researchers suggest antibiotics may contribute to childhood obesity by killing gut bacteria that normally consume some food, leaving more for the body to absorb, and potentially increasing appetite. They compare this to how antibiotics are used to fatten farm animals. The study highlights concerns about the obesity epidemic, noting that a third of 10-11 year olds and over a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese. While the study doesn't definitively prove causation, researchers warn about the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, especially given additional concerns about antibiotic resistance and other health risks like eczema and digestive problems."}

Amateur radio repeaters often use Morse code for identification despite being used for voice communications.

The conflict began as a dispute between Dinka President Salva Kiir and former Nuer Vice-President Riek Machar, but has since spread to target Equatorians in the southern states.\n\nRefugees describe fleeing extreme violence, including soldiers killing men and boys with knives and raping women and girls. Many walked for days through the bush to reach Uganda, crossing at unofficial border points.\n\nUganda has been managing the crisis well, allocating land and tarpaulins to refugee families within 36 hours of arrival. The Bidi Bidi settlement has grown from a village to one of the world's largest refugee camps, housing over 250,000 people. However, with nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with resources, particularly water supply.\n\nHalf of the refugees are children, with many having lost their parents to the violence. The UNHCR is calling for international attention and pressure on South Sudanese leaders to stop what they describe as a \"massacre of civilians from both sides.\""}

Born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, Temperton was best known for writing Michael Jackson's hit \"Thriller,\" along with other Jackson songs including \"Off The Wall,\" \"Rock With You,\" and \"Baby Be Mine.\"\n\nTemperton began his music career after working in a frozen food factory in Grimsby, joining the disco group Heatwave in the 1970s where he wrote hits like \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Always & Forever.\" His work caught the attention of producer Quincy Jones in 1978, leading to his collaboration with Michael Jackson. He contributed three songs each to Jackson's albums \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller,\" with the latter becoming the best-selling album of all time in the US with 32 million copies sold.\n\nThroughout his career, Temperton's songs were recorded by numerous artists including Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer, and Chaka Khan. He won a Grammy Award in 1990 for \"Birdland\" and received two Oscar nominations in 1986 for his work on \"The Color Purple\" soundtrack. His private funeral has already taken place, and his family has requested privacy. Many musicians and industry figures paid tribute to his legacy as one of Britain's most successful songwriters."}

Over 450 large geometrical earthworks were found after modern deforestation revealed them; they had been hidden by bamboo-dominated rainforest for centuries.\n\nThe purpose of these geoglyphs remains unclear. They were unlikely to be villages or defensive structures due to few recovered artifacts and their layout. Instead, researchers believe they were used sporadically, possibly as ritual gathering places similar to Maya pyramids or Stonehenge.\n\nAnalysis of soil samples revealed the geoglyphs were built among tall vegetation and were not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose. The research challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine before European arrival in the 16th century. Evidence shows humans cultivated a variety of plant species over 6,000 years, creating what researchers call a \"prehistoric supermarket\" by concentrating on economically valuable trees like palms rather than burning large forest areas. This ancient \"agroforestry\" practice may still influence the biodiversity of Acre's remaining forests today."}

A 2000 coup led by George Speight held the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister and cabinet hostage. The most recent coup occurred in 2006.\n\nThese events severely impacted Fiji's economy, particularly tourism, and damaged its international reputation. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth in 2009 but was reinstated after holding free elections in 2014, which also restored diplomatic ties with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFiji's population is divided between indigenous Fijians (now a small majority) and Indo-Fijians (descendants of Indian indentured laborers), with minimal mixing and deep informal segregation between the groups. Many Indo-Fijians fled following the coups.\n\nThe economy relies heavily on sugar and tourism but is diverse, including mining (gold, silver, limestone), services, and light manufacturing. However, Fiji struggles with persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita aid recipients."}

This coverage drew some criticism for giving undue prominence to a product launch, which the author defended by comparing it to potentially transformative technologies like the Model T Ford.\n\nTen years later, the author reflects that this comparison was justified, as smartphones have become transformative technology used by over two billion people, disrupting multiple industries. The author illustrates this impact through photography, contrasting a poor-quality digital SLR photo from the 2007 launch with a superior smartphone photo taken in 2017, highlighting how the iPhone revolutionized mobile photography and sharing.\n\nThe passage concludes by acknowledging that while phones had cameras and internet capabilities before 2007, Steve Jobs' genius was creating an attractive user interface that made people want to use these features. Despite initial skepticism about the hype, the author now views the iPhone launch as a historic moment that began the mobile connected era."}

Despite planning to implement austerity measures they previously opposed - including VAT increases, pension cuts, farm subsidy reductions, and privatizations - there are no protests on Athens streets.\n\nTourism is booming with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals (up from 21 million), though the country faces severe economic constraints. Banks remain partially closed following July's near-collapse, limiting lending capacity and threatening retail operations, with 70% of shops' Christmas orders typically placed in September-October.\n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras remains popular despite abandoning his anti-austerity stance after Greece's July crisis forced bank closures and economic activity to collapse. The passage suggests Tsipras now believes \"there is no alternative\" (TINA) to accepting creditors' terms.\n\nThe author argues that for the bailout to succeed and offer genuine recovery, creditors (particularly Brussels and Berlin) need to provide debt forgiveness of one-third to one-half of Greece's unsustainable debt burden, rather than maintaining a triumphalist stance over Athens' capitulation."}

As a result, many locations gave away free drinks and baked goods to customers. \n\nThe outage began in the early evening on the East Coast and late afternoon on the West Coast. While some stores remained open and accepted cash only, many locations closed early to avoid giving away free products. Excited customers took to Twitter to share news of the giveaway and post photos of their free beverages.\n\nStarbucks announced late Friday night that the issue had been resolved and stores would open for \"business as usual\" on Saturday. The outage also affected the company's Evolution Fresh and Teavana stores. This technical problem occurred just one day after Starbucks posted record quarterly earnings of $4.6 billion in net revenues."}

High-risk groups, including the very young, elderly, and most indigenous Australians, will have access to free government-funded flu shots starting April 20. The vaccine also protects against influenza A strain H1N1.\n\nDr. Alan Hampton, who chairs the influenza specialist group, emphasizes that the modified vaccine is worth waiting for and should be a good match for globally circulating strains. He recommends everyone get vaccinated, not just high-risk groups, to help protect vulnerable populations through community immunity. The same vaccine formulation will be used in the next northern hemisphere winter season."}
