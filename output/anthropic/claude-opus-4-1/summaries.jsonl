The research, published in Pediatrics, showed that by age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese, with repeated antibiotic prescriptions before age two further raising the odds of being overweight. While the study didn't prove causation, researchers suggest antibiotics may contribute to weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally consume some food, thereby freeing up more calories for the body or potentially increasing appetite. Dr. Antti Saari from Kuopio University Hospital warned that such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlighted the importance of judicious antibiotic use in infancy, noting that while antibiotics are crucial for human health, their extended use has undesirable consequences. The findings come amid concerns about over-prescription of antibiotics leading to reduced effectiveness and harder-to-treat infections, with previous research also linking infant antibiotic use to increased risks of eczema and digestive problems.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Clattenburg will be assisted by Simon Beck and Jake Collin, with Jonathan Moss as fourth official, for a derby that comes as United are riding high on five consecutive league wins while City have struggled since the new year, falling from title challengers to fighting for fourth place.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Its versatility is particularly valuable in emergencies, where it can be transmitted through simple improvised methods that can be easily switched on and off, making it one of the most accessible and adaptable forms of telecommunication.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The report identifies 816,000 expensive social housing properties (21.8% of the UK's 3.78 million total stock) worth up to £159bn, with about 28,500 becoming vacant yearly, and suggests this could reduce the 1.8 million social housing waiting list by 500,000. While the government supports councils examining this option to use housing stock more efficiently, Labour opposes forcing councils to sell properties, arguing it would break up mixed communities and drive out low-wage workers, instead proposing a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes. Critics, including the National Housing Federation and MP Karen Buck, warn the policy would push lower-income families out of affluent areas and create segregated communities, though Policy Exchange claims 73% of people support not providing council houses worth more than the local average, with director Neil O'Brien arguing it would be fairer to house two families rather than one \"lucky family\" in expensive properties.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

While NAC rules typically mandate 10oz gloves for fights at 154 pounds, both fighters submitted the necessary documentation before the deadline, though the commission must still determine if the deviation is justified based on fighter safety considerations. NAC executive director Bob Bennett explained his rationale for sanctioning the fight, citing McGregor's performance against Nate Diaz, whom boxing trainer Virgil Hunter rated as an outstanding boxer, McGregor's age advantage, physical attributes, and Mayweather's decade-long absence of knockouts. McGregor, who will make his boxing debut coming from UFC where he uses 4oz gloves, has been preparing with Hall of Fame referee Joe Cortez, who oversaw a sparring session with Paulie Malignaggi that ended controversially with Malignaggi leaving the camp after images showed him on the canvas.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Once the pinnacle of journalism careers where nearly every national paper had offices within a half-mile radius, Fleet Street was characterized by smoke-filled newsrooms, typewriters, numerous pubs filled with journalists, and a heavy drinking culture, with women journalists being a small minority often segregated from their male colleagues. The street's decline began when Rupert Murdoch moved his newspapers to Wapping in 1986, leading to a bitter dispute and triggering an exodus of other papers by 1988 as they adopted computerized printing technology, leaving behind buildings now converted to supermarkets and restaurants. Former editors and journalists recall Fleet Street as a vital information source before television and social media, where 85% of public information came through newspapers, and despite its reputation as the \"Street of Shame,\" it represented a unique period in British journalism history that has now reached its final deadline with the departure of its last two journalists.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The research revealed that prior police contact was the strongest predictor of young people not being in education, employment or training by age 18, while poorer youth were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violence, though girls from poor backgrounds were twice as likely as affluent girls to commit violent crimes, even accounting for factors like truancy and substance abuse. The study identified a destructive cycle where poverty increases violence risks and contact with juvenile justice inadvertently reproduces conditions for violence to flourish. A separate AQMeN Research Centre study showed that despite Scotland's overall crime decline to 41-year lows, the most deprived communities continue experiencing the highest crime rates, with half of high-crime areas also having the most chronic health problems and a third having the highest unemployment levels, raising questions about whether inequality is being adequately addressed despite government investments in poverty reduction initiatives.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The exercise highlights growing concerns about Russia's expanding submarine fleet of around 60 vessels, which are described as technologically advanced and among the quietest in the world, capable of going undetected for months while gathering intelligence on NATO forces. The training involves surface ships, anti-submarine helicopters, and for the first time, underwater drones to help track submarines in what is compared to finding a needle in a haystack. The exercise particularly underscores Britain's vulnerability, as it no longer has maritime patrol aircraft since retiring the Nimrod, forcing it to rely on NATO allies like France for aerial surveillance when Russian submarines are detected near UK waters, including potentially tracking Britain's nuclear deterrent leaving Faslane naval base. This gap in UK defenses is considered a critical vulnerability that needs addressing in the upcoming defense review, as Russia continues to test NATO defenses with both submarine patrols and long-range bomber flights near allied airspace.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The violence, which began as a dispute between Dinka President Salva Kiir and former Nuer Vice-President Riek Machar, has evolved into ethnic targeting with refugees reporting killings, rape, and civilians being attacked with knives rather than guns along ethnic lines, particularly targeting Equatorians, Nuer, and other non-Dinka groups.

The incident occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party, and while officers were inside searching for the owner, they heard what they believed to be gunshots outside. Oliver shot into a car full of teenagers leaving the party, and though police initially claimed the vehicle reversed aggressively toward the officer, footage showed the car was actually driving forward, away from him. Oliver was fired days later for policy violations and also faces four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the other four teenagers in the car, including two of the victim's brothers. He faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge and would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas County since 1973 if found guilty, though he is currently free on bail with no trial date set.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This makes Mrs Trump one of only a few First Ladies in US history not to immediately move into the White House, though historian William Seale notes it's not unusual for families to delay moves to allow children to finish school, citing examples like President Tyler's children and previous First Ladies who lived there only during social season. The passage discusses how recent White House families with school-age children like the Clintons and Obamas moved in immediately on Inauguration Day, with the Obamas actually relocating early to avoid mid-term school changes. Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, suggesting she may not take on the full-time ceremonial and public role that recent First Ladies like Michelle Obama have embraced, though she has expressed interest in addressing cyber-bullying. The text also explores how past presidents' daughters have occasionally fulfilled First Lady duties when needed, and notes that despite the challenges, both the Clinton and Obama families found ways to maintain normal family routines in the White House, with regular family dinners and homework sessions in the Oval Office.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Hamilton's recovery drive was hampered by aerodynamic damage to his car's floor and barge boards from the first-lap incident, and he was unable to pass Felipe Massa's Williams in the closing stages, with Raikkonen also overtaking him as Ferrari's soft tire strategy proved superior to Mercedes' medium compound choice for the final stint.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Israel rejected the resolution and Netanyahu responded by summoning ambassadors from the US and 14 countries that voted for it, recalling Israeli ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling Ukraine's prime minister's visit. The vote postponement was intended to avoid further straining relations with Washington before Kerry's speech, which was expected to lay out his vision for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict and address what officials called \"misleading critiques\" from the Israeli government, while Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the resolution \"paves the way\" for an upcoming peace conference in France on January 15.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Horwell stated that the Russian state was likely the sponsor of the plot and that the use of polonium indicated Russian state participation in some form, though he stressed this didn't necessarily implicate President Putin directly. Litvinenko, who had defected to the UK in 2000 after accusing the FSB of murdering political opponents and corruption, died in hospital nearly three weeks after being poisoned, with Horwell noting he had actually been poisoned twice and that the suspects left a trail of polonium with no credible answer to the scientific evidence against them. The barrister described the attacks as an outrage that caused great suffering and raised concerns about the unknown long-term effects of polonium exposure on Londoners, while attempts to extradite Kovtun and Lugovoi have failed as they remain in Russia.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Olam, which buys 99% of its palm oil from third parties and represents less than 1% of the global market, maintains it has a strict \"no burn-no peat-no deforestation\" policy with zero tolerance for burning, though its CEO acknowledges the vetting process will take several more years to complete. The report's significance lies in potentially linking Singapore's state fund to the annual haze affecting multiple Southeast Asian countries, as Indonesia's slash-and-burn practices for palm oil plantations regularly cause this environmental problem. Mighty also accuses Olam of bulldozing rainforests in Gabon to establish palm oil plantations, bringing destructive Southeast Asian practices to Africa, though Olam defends its operations there as responsible and transparent partnerships with the Gabonese government. The palm oil industry, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022, faces ongoing tensions between environmental groups demanding accountability and industry executives who claim policing third-party suppliers is impossible, while governments often hesitate to punish non-compliant firms due to the jobs and investment they bring to rural areas.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This venture represents a revolutionary shift in satellite manufacturing, moving from traditional expensive, \"gold-plated\" spacecraft that cost hundreds of millions to mass-production assembly lines producing three units per shift at under a million dollars each, using automation including trolley robots and new supplier chains. Airbus has opened the first assembly line in Toulouse, France, with two more planned for Florida, targeting an aggressive launch schedule using over 20 Soyuz rockets to deploy clusters of 32-36 satellites, aiming for nearly 300 satellites by end of 2020, over 600 a year later, and 800+ by mid-decade. As a UK Channel Islands-registered company that has raised $1.7 billion in equity and is seeking additional loans, OneWeb faces competition from SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat but claims first-mover advantage in the race to establish these constellations. The project addresses space debris concerns by committing to de-orbit old satellites within two years and installing hardware to enable retrieval of failed spacecraft, while the manufacturing approach may also serve other companies, though bespoke satellites for specialized missions will still be needed.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

While recommendations exist for installing Changing Places toilets - larger facilities with extra features and space - in shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities, campaigners like Lorna Fillingham are petitioning to make these guidelines compulsory in building regulations, as the current 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK are insufficient for the potentially quarter million people who need them. Families describe the psychological toll of having to change their children on dirty floors or in cars, feeling devalued and isolated from everyday activities, though some venues like Arsenal Football Club and the Principality Stadium have successfully installed these facilities. Architect Vaila Morrison explains that making Changing Places compulsory rather than recommended would provide clarity for designers who currently focus on mandatory requirements, while campaigners are specifically targeting newly built larger complexes where the 12 square metre facilities (compared to 1.5m x 2.2m for standard accessible toilets) could be more easily incorporated despite logistical and financial challenges.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

While the fishing industry hopes Brexit will allow the UK to regain control over its waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation like Norway, the report warns that fishing, representing only 0.5% of GDP and employing 12,000 people, risks being marginalised in broader Brexit negotiations. The situation is complicated by shared fish stocks with EU coastal states and the UK's heavy reliance on exporting fish to the EU while importing much of what British consumers eat. The Lords warn that maintaining crucial market access may require allowing EU boats continued access to UK waters as part of trade-offs, and that leaving the CFP could result in four different fisheries management regimes across the UK's constituent nations. Despite these concerns, industry representatives remain optimistic about Brexit opportunities, citing recent favorable quota increases and the prospect of full control over the UK's 200-mile exclusive economic zone, while the government has indicated Brexit presents an opportunity to review fisheries management for fairer access and sustainable stocks.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The surge in registrations following Theresa May's snap election announcement resulted in 2.9 million applications over six weeks, but a significant proportion were duplicates - between 30% and 70% in different areas - because the online registration system cannot communicate with local electoral registers to verify existing registrations. This disconnect between the 381 separate electoral registers in Britain created administrative burdens and made it impossible to cross-check for duplicate entries, prompting the Commission to recommend better integration of systems, including a verification function similar to those used in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. While the watchdog found no evidence supporting social media claims of widespread double voting, it emphasized that voting twice in a general election is a criminal offense punishable by unlimited fines, though people may legally register in multiple constituencies for legitimate reasons like work or study. The Commission suggested requiring people registered in two seats to declare in advance where they will vote, while Labour warned against measures that might make it harder for young people and students to register.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The match, played on the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, saw Dortmund race to a 2-0 lead in nine minutes through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, before Liverpool fought back with goals from Divock Origi, Philippe Coutinho, and Mamadou Sakho, though Marco Reus had briefly restored Dortmund's two-goal advantage. Manager Jurgen Klopp, who had invoked the spirit of Liverpool's 2005 Istanbul Champions League comeback, inspired his team to overturn the deficit in an electric Anfield atmosphere that both managers described as extraordinary. The victory moved Liverpool closer to the Europa League semi-finals and potentially Champions League qualification, with Klopp's philosophy of turning \"doubters into believers\" evident throughout the match, while the performance highlighted both the team's attacking prowess through players like Origi and Coutinho, and defensive vulnerabilities that may need addressing.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, noting the car had stolen license plates, didn't brake or stop, and witnesses described it as a deliberate act. Pring had met Ziuzina, 19 years younger and revealed to be a lap dancer rather than a teacher as claimed, online in 2006 and married her after a four-day engagement in 2007. Following his death, Ziuzina quickly tried to claim his assets, sold his Range Rover and flat contents, moved funds from his accounts, and was entitled to the first £200,000 of his estate, while computer records showed she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man. His family believes he was murdered in a staged hit-and-run for his money, and though Ukrainian police initially closed the case, they relaunched it as a murder inquiry in 2011, which remains active but not actively pursued, while Ziuzina did not attend the UK inquest despite attempts to secure her presence.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The security measure requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted phone number or through Find My iPhone app when accessing their account from a new device, in addition to their username and password. Previously, even users who had enabled two-step verification were vulnerable to having their data downloaded through tools like Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker, marketed as forensic software for law enforcement. The Moscow-based owner of Elcomsoft confirmed that Apple's changes now prevent his software from accessing iCloud backups and that users receive email notifications when backups start downloading. While the security feature remains optional rather than default, experts suggest it should be mandatory given the vulnerability of single-step password verification. Apple's CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the company's responsibility to more aggressively encourage users to enable two-factor authentication and use stronger passwords, viewing increased awareness as key to preventing future breaches.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The dossier calculates Russian spending on the conflict at 53 billion roubles (approximately $1 billion) and includes documentation of military units, weaponry photos, and testimony from Russian soldiers admitting they were directed into Ukrainian territory. The opposition accuses President Putin of masterminding the war to boost his popularity, though they face significant challenges in publishing and distributing the report, with only 2,000 initial copies printed due to publishers' fears, and acknowledge that many Russians who are aware of their country's involvement still support it, while previous similar reports by Nemtsov on corruption and Sochi Olympics costs failed to generate significant protests.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This represents a dramatic reversal from Syriza's anti-austerity platform that brought them to power earlier in the year, likely prompted by Greece's near-economic collapse in July when banks closed and economic activity ceased. While Greek tourism is booming with Athens airport expecting 25 million arrivals this year, the economy remains crippled by both fiscal and monetary austerity, with banks unable to lend and businesses struggling to obtain credit for imports, threatening retail operations. Despite failing to deliver on his promises to end austerity, Tsipras remains popular, though the article suggests that for the bailout to succeed and enable genuine recovery, creditors—particularly Brussels and Berlin—will need to provide substantial debt relief, potentially reducing Greece's unsustainable debt burden by one-third to one-half.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The research, commissioned by England's School Food Trust following concerns from the Mumsnet website about parents giving packed lunches due to fussy eating, found that carrots, sweetcorn and peas were the most popular vegetables among children, while aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were least popular. School officials and Mumsnet representatives noted that school meals help children try new foods through positive peer pressure and the desire to fit in, with meals now required to meet strict nutritional guidelines. Currently, about 40% of primary school children and slightly fewer secondary school students in England eat school lunches, compared to 46% in Scotland, with the survey conducted online between February 26 and March 5 among parents with school-aged children between 4-17 years old.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The retreat has not been uniform, with southern sectors experiencing the greatest losses - the Belledonne Massif glaciers have almost completely disappeared and the Ecrins Massif shows retreat three times stronger than Mont Blanc Massif - which researchers attribute to lower elevations in the south and different climatic conditions, as the north receives more precipitation and cloud cover. The findings mirror similar glacial retreat patterns observed across other Alpine regions, including Switzerland where researchers previously reported accelerating mass loss.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The report highlights complications including shared fish stocks with EU coastal states, the UK's heavy reliance on exporting fish to the EU while importing much of what British consumers eat, and the potential trade-off of allowing EU boats access to UK waters in exchange for continued zero-tariff market access. Additional concerns include the possibility of four different fisheries management regimes emerging across the UK's constituent nations once the unified CFP framework falls away, though industry representatives remain optimistic about opportunities for better quota shares and sustainable fisheries management as an independent coastal state with control over its 200-mile exclusive economic zone.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

He warns that relegation would make returning to the Premier League extremely difficult, noting that while the current squad is capable of survival, the club has failed to adequately replace departed players, and emphasizes to foreign signings through the documentary \"Jack to a King\" the importance of staying up for both the club and the local area.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

He revolutionized genomics by introducing automated decoding machines and focusing on RNA messenger molecules rather than entire DNA sequences, leading to his 1995 unveiling of the first complete genome of a free-living organism. In 1998, he challenged the scientific establishment by forming Celera Genomics to decode the human genome in three years, turning it into a competitive race with the public project and achieving publication alongside them in 2001, though his commercial approach and data practices drew criticism from the scientific community. After accumulating significant wealth that freed him from traditional funding constraints, he founded the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006, which successfully created Synthia, the world's first synthetic life form, published in Science journal after more than a decade of work. Beyond this achievement, he has conducted ocean expeditions on his yacht Sorcerer II to collect and sequence marine microbe genomes, and believes synthetic microbes could potentially create a new industrial revolution by helping wean society off oil and capture carbon dioxide to reverse environmental damage.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The report reveals that since 2010, 58% of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters targeted those over 25 already in work, while only 61,000 new starts were for young people, contrasting with Germany's 570,000 youth apprenticeships. England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications compared to Germany's 330, creating a complicated patchwork that confuses employers and lacks societal value, with 11 young people competing for each apprenticeship place. The report calls for radical expansion to 300,000 new apprenticeships annually, with the majority at level three lasting at least three years, arguing that the current system hinders economic competitiveness and prevents young people from gaining skilled jobs, though the Association of Colleges notes some existing level two apprenticeships are industry-respected and creating 300,000 places would be challenging given the current shortage. The Department for Education states it is already reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards, with over a million people becoming apprentices since 2010 and new requirements for minimum duration, English and maths content, and job guarantees.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The research, published in JAMA Oncology, showed that nearly half of the patients underwent the procedure an average of six years after diagnosis, with the 20-year survival rate for the entire group being 77.4%, and those who had the surgery within two years of diagnosis experiencing even greater benefits with a 73% reduction in death. The protective effect was most pronounced in women with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lasted for 15 years, though the benefit was not observed in BRCA2 mutation carriers, prompting researchers to call for more studies particularly on this group and suggesting that oophorectomy should be discussed as part of initial treatment for BRCA1 carriers with early-stage breast cancer.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

After surgery, cancer cells are screened in a lab and women receive results within days showing whether they have high or low risk of disease recurrence, with some tests like EndoPredict showing risk as low as five percent - comparable to or better than chemotherapy outcomes. While most breast cancer patients routinely receive chemotherapy after tumor removal despite its severe side effects including hair loss, nausea, and extreme fatigue, these tests allow patients to make informed decisions about whether chemotherapy is necessary. The tests currently cost about £2,500 privately, though specialists hope they will become available on the NHS since the cost could be offset by savings from avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy treatments, as demonstrated by patient Becca Cornford who was able to forgo chemotherapy after her test showed only a five percent recurrence risk.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Researchers and public health experts attribute these increases to changing social norms that make it more acceptable for women to drink like men, the influx of affluent professionals in tech hubs, cheaper alcohol prices relative to inflation, increased alcohol advertising spending of $3.45 billion in 2011, and weakened alcohol control policies, while noting that alcohol-related deaths reached 88,600 in 2010 with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This WHO stance contradicts current NHS guidelines which, following 2011 NICE recommendations, allow women to have the operation even without medical justification if they have severe anxiety about childbirth (tokophobia), had previous complicated births, are over 40, or have conditions like asthma, diabetes or depression, with research showing that as many as one in ten caesareans cause infections.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The Omura's whale has distinctive features including a sleek body shape, 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin, and the knowledge gained from this specimen will help improve field identification guides and better understand the whale's regional distribution.

The piece argues that gender equality benefits everyone - improving corporate performance, family dynamics, and marriages - and emphasizes that the real barrier to female leadership isn't biological but rather persistent societal bias, concluding with the ironic note that Rios threatened to move to Canada if Clinton were elected, apparently unaware that Canada had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The judge granted Bates permission to vacation in the Bahamas, which the Harris family criticized as showing apathy toward the shooting, while Bates' preliminary hearing was set for July 2. The Harris family's lawyer alleges Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force but received preferential treatment due to donations to the agency and friendship with Sheriff Stanley Glanz, with the Tulsa World reporting that supervisors were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused, though the sheriff's office denies these allegations. Bates has apologized to the Harris family, his lawyers released training documents they say prove proper law enforcement training, and two deputies involved in Harris's arrest were reassigned due to threats against them and their families.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The outbreak, centered about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, has occurred among intravenous drug users primarily using the painkiller Opana, in a county that typically sees only five HIV cases annually. The temporary needle exchange program has distributed 5,322 clean syringes to 86 participants and collected about 1,400 used syringes, with participation increasing through mobile unit outreach efforts. Despite the program's implementation, the number of cases continues to rise as more people are tested, putting pressure on Pence to extend the program beyond its April 25 expiration date. The situation has sparked legislative debate, with the House approving a bill that would allow 23 Indiana counties with high hepatitis C rates to establish needle-exchange programs, though Senate support remains uncertain and Pence opposes needle exchanges as anti-drug policy. The program faces challenges including lack of dedicated funding, as Pence's executive order didn't include money for the initiative and federal funding for needle exchanges has been banned since 1989, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of such harm-reduction efforts in addressing the state's largest-ever HIV outbreak.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Lillian, who weighs 240 pounds, cited statistics showing workplace size discrimination has risen 66 percent in 30 years and that being thinner is the top wish for girls aged 11-17, but she also shared research indicating that exposure to body diversity increases acceptance and preference for different body types. She began performing burlesque in 2012 after being inspired at her first show, finding it empowering and body-positive despite initial nervousness about her appearance, and she uses her performances to expose audiences to a \"fat\" body in a glamorous, positive way. Her TED talk, posted on YouTube three weeks after being given in 2014, has garnered nearly 38,000 views and mostly positive feedback, including messages from viewers saying it helped them reevaluate their body image, leading Lillian to believe that the body-positivity movement is winning.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, analyzing 130 million telescope images and measuring galaxy shapes with extreme precision to detect dark matter through gravitational lensing, a technique that observes how dark matter's gravity distorts light from distant galaxies. Dark matter, which makes up about 85 percent of all matter in the universe but cannot be directly observed, reveals itself through these gravitational effects, and the resulting maps show large filaments where galaxies cluster near dark matter concentrations (shown in red) and cosmic voids with few galaxies where dark matter is sparse (shown in blue). This mapping project, which requires enormous computing power and will continue until 2018, aims to create a 3D view of dark matter across one-eighth of the night sky, helping astronomers study galaxy formation and probe the nature of dark energy by analyzing how the clumpiness of dark matter changes over time.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The breed's decline is attributed to China's anti-corruption crackdown that stopped wealthy businessmen from gifting the dogs to officials, bans on owning dogs over 50kg in major Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, and unscrupulous breeding practices that led to cross-breeding and deterioration in quality, creating a glut of poor-quality dogs. The crisis was revealed when animal welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs being transported to slaughter in cramped cages, with a third already dead and others suffering from broken bones after three days without food or water, while experts note that rapid urbanization has made people realize these dogs are unsuitable for city living, marking the end of their status symbol era that began in 2005.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Following England's game against France, Brown experienced headaches but no specific incident of dizziness or concussion, prompting him to be cautious to avoid the extended breaks experienced by players like Johnny Sexton (12 weeks) and George North (advised not to play for the rest of the season after four concussions). Brown, who was knocked out during England's 47-17 victory over Italy in February and subsequently missed the Ireland match, credits World Rugby's online modules for increasing his awareness of concussion symptoms, which helped him recognize he wasn't ready to play despite the importance of matches. He emphasizes that the education about short and long-term dangers has made him more willing to withdraw from significant games rather than risk his health, and he now advocates for teammates to do the same if showing symptoms, stating \"it's just not worth pushing through.\"","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

According to his book \"Sex by Numbers\" and statements to BBC Radio, the blurring of boundaries between public and private lives, with people constantly checking emails and having less quiet time, has squeezed out time couples would spend together, while researcher Catherine Mercer notes that competing demands and late-night work emails leave people too connected to the outside world to focus on their partners at bedtime.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The breed's decline is attributed to China's anti-corruption crackdown that stopped wealthy businessmen from gifting the dogs to officials, bans on owning dogs over 50kg in major Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, and unscrupulous breeding practices that led to cross-breeding and deterioration in quality, creating a glut of poor-quality dogs. The crisis was revealed when animal welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs being transported to slaughter in cramped cages, with a third already dead and others suffering from broken bones after three days without food or water, while experts note that rapid urbanization has made people realize these dogs are unsuitable for city living, marking the end of their status symbol era that began in 2005.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-opus-4-1","date_code":"20250805","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}
