The conflict began when Merson wrote in his Sky Sports column that Townsend's England selection meant the team was open to anybody. Townsend responded by scoring a stunning equaliser for England against Italy in a 1-1 draw, after which Merson admitted he was wrong and praised the goal. Merson had based his original opinion on Townsend being substituted after thirty minutes at Manchester United in front of England manager Roy Hodgson. Townsend mocked Merson on Twitter after his England goal, but Merson took another jab at him following the Burnley match.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with those who received antibiotics as young babies particularly affected. Repeated prescriptions before age two increased the risk, with boys especially prone to weight gain and slightly increased height. Researchers suggest antibiotics may contribute to childhood obesity by killing gut bacteria that normally consume food, freeing up more calories for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The study, published in Pediatrics, emphasizes the need for careful antibiotic use in infancy, as their overuse may be contributing to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic alongside other concerns like antibiotic resistance and increased risk of eczema and digestive problems.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Atmospheric winds carried lingering smoke across the Pacific Ocean to the Pacific Northwest, affecting Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The intense red color occurs because smoke particles filter out shorter wavelength colors like greens, blues, yellows, and purples, allowing red and orange to penetrate unfiltered.

Both teams lead Group B with 11 points from five games, with Belgium top on goal difference despite being ranked fourth in the world. Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel has heightened expectations that Chris Coleman's team can secure automatic qualification for the 2016 finals in France. The Football Association of Wales reported overwhelming ticket demand following the Israel performance. The match will remain at Cardiff City Stadium rather than the larger 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium, partly due to UEFA rules preventing venue changes within 120 days and because the Wales squad prefers the more intimate Cardiff venue, where they haven't played since a Euro 2012 qualifier against England in March 2011. This represents Wales' best opportunity to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen testified that Costa was likely suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time, with evidence showing his mental state had been declining in the lead-up to the incident. Mullen cited Costa's fluctuating mood during triple 0 calls made during the attack and a trail of faeces suggesting confusion as indicators of his compromised mental state. The prosecutor suggested Costa feigned memory loss, which Mullen denied. Costa's mental state is critical to the case, as the jury can return a not guilty verdict if his unstable mindset at the time of the attack is proven.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The think tank defines expensive social housing as properties worth more than the regional average, representing 21.8% of total social housing stock (816,000 properties worth up to £159bn). With 3.5% of stock becoming vacant yearly, approximately 28,500 properties could be sold annually. Policy Exchange argues this would create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s and reduce the 1.8 million social housing waiting list by 500,000. The prime minister's spokesman said councils should use housing stock efficiently and consider such sales. Labour opposed the plan, calling it a failed policy that would break up mixed communities and drive out low-wage families from neighborhoods. Critics, including the National Housing Federation and Labour MPs, warned it would push less well-off residents out of expensive areas, creating segregated communities.

The first study, tracking 4,300 young people since 1998, found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children committing the same crime, and five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Poverty increased the likelihood of violence for both boys and girls, even when accounting for other risk factors. Police contact was the strongest predictor of young people not being in education, employment or training by age 18. The second study found that despite falling crime rates in Scotland, victims experiencing the most crime remain in the most deprived communities. Half of the highest crime areas were in the top 20% for chronic health problems, and a third were in the top 20% for unemployment. Researchers concluded that contact with juvenile justice systems inadvertently reproduces conditions where violence flourishes, and questioned whether inequality is being adequately addressed. The Scottish government responded that Scotland is becoming safer with recorded crime at a 41-year low and cited investments to tackle poverty.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The exercise is a response to increased Russian submarine activity near Sweden, Finland, and the UK. Russia has invested heavily in a fleet of approximately 60 technologically advanced submarines, described as the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world,\" while European nations have cut defense spending. The exercise employs warships, helicopters, and for the first time, underwater drones to locate submarines. Significantly, the exercise exposes a critical gap in British defenses: the UK lacks maritime patrol aircraft previously provided by Nimrod, forcing reliance on NATO allies when Russian submarines appear near British waters. This vulnerability means Russian submarines could potentially track Britain's nuclear deterrent leaving Faslane naval base undetected.

Only two previous First Ladies have not lived in the White House: Martha Washington before it was built, and Anna Harrison whose husband died before she could move in. However, historians note that delayed moves for school-age children are not unusual, citing examples like Grover Cleveland's wife who spent most time at a separate residence, and John Tyler's children who didn't move immediately. Recent presidential children like Chelsea Clinton and the Obama daughters moved in on inauguration day, with the Obamas relocating early to avoid mid-term school changes. The First Lady's role is ceremonial as White House hostess, though modern First Ladies have championed causes like Michelle Obama's Let Girls Learn initiative. Melania Trump has indicated Barron will be her priority and has expressed interest in tackling cyber-bullying. While presidential daughters have occasionally assumed First Lady duties when presidents were widowers, Ivanka Trump could potentially take on some responsibilities.

These ditched enclosures are unlikely to be villages or defensive structures due to few artifacts and their layout; instead they may have been ritual gathering places used sporadically. Analysis of soil samples, including phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon isotopes, revealed the geoglyphs were built among tall vegetation, making them invisible above the forest canopy unlike other ritual sites. The research challenges assumptions that pre-16th Century Amazonian forests were pristine, showing humans transformed the environment over 6,000 years by cultivating economically valuable trees like palms rather than burning large forest areas, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful products.

The UK has dropped from fourth to sixth place globally in defence spending. Most major parties avoid committing to NATO's 2% GDP spending target, with projections suggesting UK spending could fall to 1.5-1.7% by decade's end - requiring an additional £25bn over five years to maintain 2%. Further cuts of £2bn-£3bn annually appear likely, though Conservative commitments on Trident, equipment budgets, and army size may limit options. Trident renewal remains contentious, with parties divided on replacing four submarines or maintaining continuous patrols, potentially consuming a quarter of equipment spending.

His competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October, and he must still serve eight remaining games of his nine-match international ban. Suarez's legal team argued Fifa's punishment was disproportionate, while Cas determined that prohibiting training would unfairly impact the player beyond the suspension period. The £75m Barcelona signing had previously been suspended twice for biting incidents and once for racial abuse.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

While the industry voted heavily to leave the EU and views Brexit as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters, the report warns fishing may be marginalized in negotiations despite its importance to coastal communities. The UK may need to grant EU boats access to British waters in exchange for tariff-free market access, since most UK fish are exported to the EU. The report recommends retaining elements of the Common Fisheries Policy, including scientific advice for quotas, and notes the UK remains under international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states. A concern is that leaving the CFP could create four separate fisheries regimes across UK nations. The fishing industry remains optimistic, citing recent quota increases and anticipating better control as an independent coastal state. The government states it seeks maximum trading freedom while reviewing fisheries management for fair quota access and sustainable stocks.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The NSA requested millions of phone records from Verizon and allegedly accessed servers of nine major technology companies through a program called Prism, established in 2007. US officials, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, called the leaks extremely damaging to national security, while NSA Director Keith Alexander defended the operations as necessary to keep Americans secure. President Obama stated that complete security requires some sacrifice of privacy and convenience. Senator Dianne Feinstein claimed phone records were only accessed when individuals were suspected of connections to al-Qaeda or Iran. The companies named denied involvement, and experts debate Prism's actual capabilities. User data is often stored in the US regardless of users' locations, subjecting it to US Patriot Act and FISA Act provisions. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague refused to confirm whether British intelligence had Prism access and stated law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about. The EU Justice Commission expressed concern and sought more details. Snowden said he leaked the information because he found the surveillance extent horrifying and didn't want to live in a society where everything is recorded.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether to grant the appeal, with an interim injunction remaining in place until the hearing concludes. The case involves the Sun on Sunday wanting to publish details of alleged extra-marital sexual encounters between PJS and another person (AB), including a three-way encounter with AB's partner (CD) in 2011. PJS, who has young children and a spouse also in the public eye, argues for privacy rights. Initially, a High Court refused an injunction, but Appeal Court judges imposed one preventing identification in England and Wales. However, News Group Newspapers successfully argued the ban should be lifted because the story had already been published in the US, Scotland, and spread widely on the internet and Twitter.

Of 4.9 million applications submitted between December 2016 and the May deadline, the net increase was only 1.4 million, suggesting duplicate applications ranged from 30-70% in different areas. The issue stems from electoral registers and the online registration system using different databases that cannot communicate directly, with no way for people to check if they're already registered. The Commission recommends better integration of the 381 separate electoral registers to identify duplicates and reduce double voting risk, and suggests people registered in two constituencies should choose in advance where to vote.

The main problem was long waiting times, particularly for patients with vague symptoms or those needing tests to rule out serious illness - over 25% of 30,000 cancer cases fell into this category. Denmark introduced three diagnostic routes: fast-track pathways for patients with alarm symptoms of specific cancers, with a legal requirement that any physical illness be investigated within 30 days of GP referral; diagnostic centres at hospitals where patients with unclear symptoms receive quick tests and scans; and \"yes-no\" centres offering simple tests for patients with minor symptoms, where 1% are found to have serious disease. Previously, this last group might have waited four to six months. The changes improved organisation within existing resources without flooding the system with referrals, and Denmark's cancer survival rates are now improving faster than other Scandinavian countries.

Initially struggling to access the device for filming, the author obtained one from Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller. The coverage drew criticism for giving excessive prominence to a product launch, with the journalist defending it by comparing the iPhone's potential impact to the Model T Ford. A decade later, this comparison proved apt, as smartphones became the key transformative technology, putting powerful computers in over two billion hands and disrupting numerous industries. The author illustrates this through photography, showing how smartphone cameras evolved to match professional equipment while enabling instant social media sharing. While cameras and internet existed on phones before 2007, Steve Jobs' innovation was creating an attractive user interface that made people want to use these features beyond basic calls and texts. The journalist concludes that despite initial British skepticism about the launch's hyperbole, the event marked the beginning of the mobile connected era, preceding later innovations from companies like Amazon and Google.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

After serving as a medical orderly during the Vietnam War's Tet offensive, he developed a sense of urgency about time. Working at the NIH in the 1980s, he pioneered faster gene sequencing methods by focusing on messenger RNA rather than entire genomes, though this approach was dismissed by some, including James Watson. Following funding rejection, Venter left the NIH in 1992 to establish a private research institute. In 1995, he sequenced the first complete genome of a free-living organism. In 1998, he founded Celera Genomics to decode the human genome in three years, competing with a public project; both published results in 2001. His approach to data access drew criticism but brought financial success. In 2006, he formed the J. Craig Venter Institute, which after over a decade created Synthia, the first synthetic life form, published in Science journal.

The minute-long song features simple, repetitive lyrics about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple, accompanied by a basic dance routine. Originally uploaded to YouTube, the video gained over 4 million views, while a Facebook version by 9GAG reached over 44 million views. The song's viral success is attributed to its addictive beat, silly lyrics, and simple choreography. Reactions have been mixed, with some finding it catchy and amusing while others find it annoying. The phenomenon has spawned numerous tributes and covers from various performers, including Japanese stars and international social media personalities. Despite international attention, mainstream Japanese news sites have given it limited coverage, and it hasn't significantly trended on Japanese social media. Some suggest it was deliberately designed to become a global phenomenon similar to Psy's viral success.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Australian High Commissioner Alexander Downer addressed crowds, reflecting on the courage of Anzac troops at Gallipoli. The events honor the sacrifices of Australian and New Zealand servicemen and women in all wars, with veterans, service personnel, families, and expatriates participating.

Born in 1946, he initially pursued surfing but was drafted to Vietnam in 1967, where his experience as a hospital orderly inspired him to become a doctor and instilled a sense of urgency. During his research career at the NIH in the 1980s, he pioneered faster gene sequencing methods by focusing on messenger RNA rather than entire genomes, achieving unprecedented rates. After leaving the NIH in 1992 due to criticism and funding issues, he founded The Institute for Genomic Research and in 1995 sequenced the first complete genome of a free-living organism. In 1998, he formed Celera Genomics to decode the human genome in three years, competing with a public 10-year project; both published results in 2001. His approach, particularly regarding data access, drew criticism but brought financial success. He subsequently founded the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006, leading efforts to create synthetic life, resulting in an organism called Synthia published in Science after over a decade of work.

After a pilot in five schools, the charity hopes for wider rollout across Northern Ireland. The programme consists of interactive workshops that promote emotional wellbeing awareness, encourage help-seeking, identify support sources, and provide teacher training. Launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, the initiative addresses anxiety in pupils and parents about moving from the close-knit primary environment to larger secondary schools. Around 14,681 pupils sat unofficial transfer tests in 2016, a slight increase from 2015. Workshops teach breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. Northern Ireland's chief inspector of schools has identified strengthening young people's resilience as a key challenge, noting that the social context of children's lives has changed significantly and recommending stronger preventative education within the pastoral care curriculum.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This contrasts sharply with their previous Honda partnership era, when they won 15 of 16 races in 1988 with Senna and Prost. Their last constructors' title was in 1998 with Hakkinen. They were excluded from the 2007 constructors' championship despite scoring the most points, due to possessing illegal Ferrari technical information and receiving a $100m fine.

Nine deaths from ovarian cancer occurred among women who did not have the procedure.

Curtin's attorney stated the ex-girlfriend had harassed Curtin for two years and attempted to pull the boyfriend back into addiction. The boyfriend, father of Curtin's child, had struggled with heroin and shares a five-year-old with his ex. Curtin gave birth in January and now lives with her parents; the boyfriend is not involved with the new child. A conviction would have resulted in nearly six years in prison.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The author counters that male hormones have historically impaired male leaders' judgment, and studies show women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks. The piece argues that despite women outnumbering men in education and the workforce, workplace gender bias remains pervasive in 2015, citing examples like corporate boards having more men named John, Robert, William, or James than women total, and professors being described as \"geniuses\" versus \"nice\" based on gender. The author contends this bias will make Clinton's presidential path more difficult and emphasizes that gender equality benefits everyone—improving corporate profits, child development, marriages, and team performance.

The outbreak, occurring among intravenous drug users primarily using the painkiller Opana, prompted Gov. Mike Pence to approve a 30-day needle exchange program on March 26. Since implementation, 5,322 clean syringes have been distributed to 86 participants and about 1,400 used syringes returned. Pence will decide early next week whether to extend the program beyond April 25. Separately, legislation allowing 23 Indiana counties with high hepatitis C rates to establish needle-exchange programs passed the House 54-39 and awaits conference committee review. The program's future remains uncertain as Pence opposes needle exchanges as anti-drug policy, and funding is unclear since federal law bans public funding for such programs and Pence's executive order included no dedicated money.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

New Balance, replacing sister company Warrior, presented their first kit design under a record-breaking £300million four-year deal. Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Martin Skrtel, and Simon Mignolet modeled the new gingham-design strip with the message \"hold nothing back.\" This follows Sterling's recent rejection of a £100,000-a-week contract and his comments about being flattered by Arsenal links, though Liverpool insist the 20-year-old will not leave despite having two years remaining on his contract. Players also discussed the upcoming FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, with the new kit featuring all-white branding and a new collar style.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The map was produced by Dr Sarah Bridle's team analyzing 130 million telescope images of galaxies over two years, measuring galaxy shapes with extreme precision using supercomputers. The data comes from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile as part of the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), which aims to map 12.5 per cent of the sky by 2018. Since dark matter cannot be directly observed, the map uses gravitational lensing - detecting how dark matter's gravity distorts light from distant galaxies. The map shows dark matter forms large filaments where visible galaxies cluster, supporting theories that galaxies form where dark matter concentrations are strongest. This represents three percent of the area DES will ultimately document, and analyzing dark matter clumpiness will help scientists understand dark energy and the universe's accelerating expansion.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Research shows typical heterosexual couples now have sex three times monthly, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Professor David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician, attributes this decline to increased technological connectivity blurring boundaries between public and private life. People constantly check emails, eliminating quiet time previously available. While more people living alone is one factor, the primary explanation is that technology has made lives busier, eroding work-home boundaries and squeezing out time for partners.

The decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which ended the practice of wealthy businessmen gifting the dogs to officials, and bans on dogs over 50kg in major cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The breed, which can weigh up to 80kg and was traditionally used for herding in Tibet, saw its boom begin in 2005. Animal welfare workers recently rescued 20 mastiffs heading to slaughter, finding a third already dead with survivors unfed for three days and suffering broken bones. The market collapse has been worsened by cross-breeding that deteriorated the dogs' quality, creating a glut of unsellable specimens. Gangs are also stealing mastiffs from streets to sell to slaughterhouses, and breeders are offloading imperfect dogs to abattoirs.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The harassment ranges from insults and intimidating behavior to sexual assault and rape. Six out of ten women fear being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men. These largely unreported incidents force women to alter their daily routines, including routes, transportation modes, schedules, and clothing, effectively limiting their freedom and excluding them from public spaces. The report, presented to France's women's rights ministry, prompted calls for campaigns to address sexist and threatening behavior on public transport. Officials emphasized that women need better education about recognizing harassment as abnormal, while attackers currently feel they can act with impunity by hiding in crowds.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-sonnet-4-5","date_code":"20250929","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}
