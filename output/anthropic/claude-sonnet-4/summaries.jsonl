The research, published in Pediatrics, showed that by age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with those who received early antibiotics being particularly likely to be overweight. Boys appeared more susceptible to antibiotic-related weight gain and were also slightly taller.\n\nThe researchers suggest antibiotics may contribute to weight gain by killing beneficial gut bacteria that normally consume food, leaving more available for the body, and potentially increasing appetite. While the study doesn't prove causation, the authors warn that antibiotic use in infancy may contribute to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic. The findings add to existing concerns about antibiotic over-prescription, which has previously been linked to increased risks of eczema, digestive problems, and antibiotic resistance."}

Atmospheric winds carried the lingering smoke across the Pacific Ocean to the Pacific Northwest, affecting parts of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The intense red color occurs because smoke particles filter out shorter wavelength colors (greens, blues, yellows, purples) from sunlight, allowing red and orange colors to penetrate unfiltered.

He regularly places his hand in the tank to stroke and massage the fish, which responds by swimming into his hand, staying still during the interaction, and appearing to enjoy the sensation. The fish actively seeks out this contact, swimming around his fingers and following his hand to the surface when he removes it.\n\nThis unique bond developed after Giroux removed two other fish from the tank that were bullying his pet, then began hand-feeding it frozen blood worms. The fish gradually became more sociable and now expects daily interaction, becoming frustrated without it. Giroux dedicates at least 15 minutes each day to massaging and playing with the fish. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid species first bred in Taiwan around 1986, created from crossing midas and redhead cichlids."}

They propose using bank bonus taxes to fund 250,000 affordable homes instead.\n\n**Debate**: Supporters argue it's fairer to house more families rather than one \"lucky family\" in expensive areas. Critics warn it would create segregated communities and push the least well-off into \"ghettos,\" with towns being \"cleansed\" of hardworking people who cannot afford high prices."}

Key factors included McGregor's performance against Nate Diaz (whom boxing trainers rated highly), McGregor's physical advantages (12 years younger, taller, longer reach), and Mayweather's lack of knockouts in recent years.\n\n**Fight Significance**: This represents McGregor's transition from UFC (where he uses 4oz gloves) to boxing against the undefeated 40-year-old Mayweather in what could be the richest fight in history. The 29-year-old UFC lightweight champion's move has drawn criticism from major boxing figures.\n\n**Preparation Details**: Bennett has monitored McGregor's training progress through videos and confirmed he's \"good to go.\" McGregor's camp hired Hall of Fame referee Joe Cortez, who oversaw sparring sessions including a controversial one with Paulie Malignaggi that led to Malignaggi leaving the camp."}

Reporters Gavin Sherriff (32 years on Fleet Street) and Darryl Smith (25 years) were the last journalists working there. \n\nFleet Street was historically the heart of British newspapers, beginning with the first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, published there in 1702. At its peak, nearly every national paper had offices within a half-mile radius, and it was considered the pinnacle of a journalist's career. The street was famous for its many pubs where journalists socialized and sought stories.\n\nThe decline began in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, leading to a bitter dispute with unions. By 1988, most national newspapers had relocated, adopting computerized printing technology. Former newspaper buildings were converted to other uses, such as Sainsbury's headquarters replacing Mirror Group Newspapers.\n\nAccording to former editor Robin Esser, Fleet Street was crucial when 85% of public information came through newspapers, before television and social media developed. The closure represents the final end of this significant era in British journalism history."}

Russian submarines are described as technologically advanced, highly skilled, and capable of remaining undetected for months.\n\nThe exercise highlighted significant gaps in Britain's defenses, particularly the lack of maritime patrol aircraft (previously provided by Nimrod aircraft).

The sculpture is believed to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, southern India. The theft allegations emerged during a 2012 court case against the dealer for antiquities trafficking, where the company's manager Aaron Freedman admitted to selling stolen Indian antiquities and possessing 150 stolen objects. Following an official request from India's Archaeological Survey of India in May, Singapore's National Heritage Board agreed to return the sculpture after discussions between the two governments. The museum acknowledged there was no conclusive proof of theft but cited Freedman's confession as the basis for their decision. The sculpture was one of 30 objects ACM purchased from the dealer, though the others are not considered stolen. The museum plans to pursue legal action for compensation due to the apparent fraud."}

These large ditched enclosures were hidden by rainforest until modern deforestation revealed them. The sites are believed to have been used sporadically as ritual gathering places rather than villages or defensive structures, similar to Stonehenge or Maya pyramids.\n\nAnalysis of soil samples revealed the geoglyphs were built among tall vegetation, making them invisible above the forest canopy, which raises questions about their purpose. The research challenges previous assumptions that Amazonian forests were pristine before European arrival in the 16th century. Instead, evidence shows humans artificially cultivated diverse plant species over 6,000 years, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" by concentrating economically valuable trees like palms rather than burning large forest areas.

Half of parents reported their children requested school foods to be cooked at home. The most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas, while aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were least popular.\n\nThe England's School Food Trust commissioned this research after a Mumsnet survey suggested some parents provided packed lunches believing their children were too fussy for school meals. Officials noted that school meals can help parents encourage children to try new foods and increase dietary variety. The research indicated that peer pressure and desire to fit in motivates children to try more foods at school than at home.\n\nSchool meals in England must now comply with strict nutritional guidelines and have improved significantly. About 40% of primary school children and slightly fewer secondary school children in England eat school lunches, compared to 46% in Scotland. The survey was conducted online between February 26 and March 5 among parents with children aged 4-17."}

Goalkeeper Joe Hart defended Pellegrini, saying the players have let the manager down and should take responsibility for disappointing performances. \n\nAdditionally, West Ham manager Sam Allardyce warned left-back Aaron Cresswell against joining City, citing examples of English players like Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair who moved to City but received limited playing time."}

Baldwin worked in the foreign missions branch, which deals with diplomatic activities and is attached to the State Department. Following his arrest, the Secret Service revoked his security clearance and placed him on administrative leave. Baldwin was scheduled for arraignment Friday afternoon. This incident follows recent misconduct allegations against a high-ranking supervisor and is part of a series of problems for the agency, including a March 4 incident where two senior officials allegedly drove into a secure White House area after drinking. The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general is investigating these various incidents involving the agency responsible for protecting the president."}

After surgery, cancer cells are screened in a lab, and within days women learn if they have high or low risk of cancer recurrence. For some women, the test shows recurrence risk as low as 5%, which matches or exceeds the protection offered by chemotherapy.\n\nCurrently, most breast cancer patients routinely receive chemotherapy after tumor removal to prevent recurrence, despite severe side effects including hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. The newest test, called EndoPredict, allows low-risk patients to opt out of chemotherapy. These tests cost about £2,500 and are mainly available privately, though specialists hope they will become available on the NHS.\n\nThe passage includes a case study of Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother who used the EndoPredict test and learned her 10-year recurrence risk was only 5%, allowing her to skip chemotherapy while maintaining similar protective odds."}

Carwyn continued ahead and left the piste, entering dense woodland where he removed his skis and continued on foot, apparently trying to reach the resort he could see through the trees. He fell over a 164-foot drop and died.

His family said his death left a \"vast void in their hearts.\" The boy attended Ysol y Bannau school in Brecon, and his family runs an award-winning farm shop. His body was ready for repatriation while the family remained in the Alps."}

What began as a sensible diet with her mother's agreement escalated into a dangerous obsession where she would hide food, lie about eating, and survive on just one piece of fruit or about 100 calories per day. Her severe food restriction caused her body to shut down - her heart rate slowed dramatically, leading to dizziness and fainting. After a week of eating virtually nothing, Laura collapsed at home and was rushed to intensive care, where she spent a week on a heart monitor. Following her hospitalization, she received support from eating disorder organizations and mental health services for her recovery.

The survey uses the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile.\n\n**Methodology**: Since dark matter cannot be directly observed, researchers measure its gravitational effects on galaxies through a technique called gravitational lensing. The team analyzed 130 million telescope images, measuring galaxy shapes with extreme precision to detect distortions caused by dark matter's gravity.\n\n**Scientific Significance**: The map shows that galaxies form near dark matter concentrations, supporting current cosmological theories. Dark matter makes up at least 80% of matter in the universe, and studying its distribution helps scientists understand both dark matter and dark energy.\n\n**Current Status**: The survey has completed two years and will finish by 2018, ultimately mapping one-eighth of the night sky. The released map represents only 3% of the total area that will be documented."}
