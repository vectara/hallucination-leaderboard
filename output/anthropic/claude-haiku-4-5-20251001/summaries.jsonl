By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with antibiotic-exposed children showing higher rates. Repeated antibiotic prescriptions before age two increased the likelihood of excess weight, particularly in boys who were also slightly taller. The researchers suggest antibiotics may cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally digest food, freeing up more calories for the body and potentially increasing appetite. While the study did not prove causation, the findings suggest antibiotic use in infancy may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the need for judicious antibiotic use. Previous research has also linked early antibiotic exposure to eczema and digestive problems.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The goal came after Chelsea captain John Terry made a strong challenge from behind on Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao near the halfway line, sending Falcao to the ground. Cesc Fabregas collected the loose ball, released it to Oscar, whose back-heel sent it to Hazard to score. Sky Sports pundits Graeme Souness, Thierry Henry, and Jamie Redknapp agreed during half-time analysis that Terry's challenge on Falcao was a foul that should have stopped play. Souness noted Terry used his elbow on Falcao's head, Henry said he would have wanted a foul in that position as a striker, and Redknapp acknowledged it was a foul despite Falcao potentially being stronger to stay on his feet.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The NAC will debate the matter publicly on 16 August before deciding. Lighter gloves offer less cushioning but theoretically deliver more punishing punches. The undefeated fighter coming out of retirement had previously posted on Instagram about wearing 8oz gloves but had not initially submitted the required waiver document. NAC rules allow 8oz gloves for bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs if waivers are signed and justified. The NAC executive director emphasized that fighter health and safety is the priority when deviating from regulations. The 29-year-old UFC lightweight champion is making his boxing debut against a 40-year-old opponent in what could be the richest fight in history. The NAC director studied extensive information before approving the fight, citing the fighter's younger age, height, reach advantage, and a granite-like chin, along with observations that the opponent hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. A Hall of Fame boxing referee was hired to oversee the bout.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Fleet Street was once the center of British journalism, home to major national newspapers and the birthplace of the first British daily newspaper in 1702. At its peak, the street was famous for its bars filled with journalists and represented a pinnacle of the profession. However, the decline began in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, followed by most other national newspapers relocating by 1988 due to new computerized printing technology. The buildings were subsequently converted to other uses, such as Sainsbury's supermarket replacing Mirror Group Newspapers. The closure of the Sunday Post's office represents the end of an era for Fleet Street journalism.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action for the same crimes as better-off children, and five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor for offending even when other risk factors were controlled for. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as affluent girls to be involved in violent crime. A history of police contact was the strongest predictor of youth unemployment or underemployment by age 18. A separate study by the AQMeN Research Centre found that despite Scotland's crime rates being at a 41-year low, crime remains concentrated in deprived communities, with half of high-crime communities in the top 20% of areas with chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% of areas with highest unemployment. Prof McAra noted that contact with the juvenile justice system inadvertently reproduces conditions in which violence flourishes.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The exercise is a response to increased Russian submarine patrols in European waters. Russia operates approximately 60 submarines, including advanced nuclear-powered and diesel-electric vessels, and has recently launched what it claims is the world's quietest submarine. The exercise highlights a significant gap in British defenses: the UK lacks maritime patrol aircraft, a capability previously provided by the Nimrod, forcing Britain to rely on NATO allies for surveillance of Russian submarines near its waters. The exercise employs various detection methods including sonar, sensors, helicopters, and for the first time, underwater unmanned drones.

Refugees report systematic violence including murder and sexual assault. Uganda has responded generously, allocating land and shelter to families within 36 hours, but with nearly a million refugees now in the country, resources like water supply are becoming strained. About half the refugees are children, with schools operating in settlements like Bidi Bidi, which has grown from a village to one of the world's largest refugee settlements covering 250 square kilometers.

This decision has drawn criticism on social media, as only two other First Ladies in U.S. history have not resided in the White House during their husbands' presidencies. However, historians note that children staying back to finish school is not unusual, and precedent exists for this arrangement. While the official role of First Lady is ceremonial, involving hosting functions and supporting causes, Melania has indicated Barron will be her priority, suggesting she may not take on the full-time role of recent predecessors like Michelle Obama. Her only stated policy interest is tackling cyber-bullying. Past First Families have successfully balanced White House life with maintaining family privacy and normal routines, with some children completing their education before or after moving to the residence.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The painting depicts a leper squint—holes in medieval church walls that allowed excluded people to view services. Simpson, who had been shortlisted previously, described the relatively small 7ft-high work as part of a series he has been developing. Judge Ansel Krut praised it as \"quite extraordinary,\" noting its technical subtlety and minimal language that builds emotional resonance over time. Simpson plans to use the prize money for art materials, particularly quality paints and canvas. The John Moores Painting Prize, established in 1957, is one of Britain's oldest biennial art awards, with previous winners including David Hockney and Peter Doig.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

These ditched enclosures were hidden by rainforest until modern deforestation revealed them. Their function remains unclear, but they were likely used sporadically as ritual gathering places rather than villages or defensive structures. Analysis of soil samples, including phytoliths and charcoal, indicates the geoglyphs were built among tall vegetation and were not visible above the forest canopy, distinguishing them from other ritual sites like Maya pyramids. The research challenges the assumption that pre-16th century Amazonian forests were pristine, revealing instead that humans deliberately cultivated diverse plant species over 6,000 years, concentrating on economically valuable trees like palms in a form of \"prehistoric supermarket.\" This ancient \"agroforestry\" practice may have left a lasting legacy in Acre's remaining forests today.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The study, based on 2013-14 Australian workplace relations data, refutes the \"reticent female\" theory that women avoid requesting salary increases due to reluctance to upset their boss or deviate from gender stereotypes. By comparing like-for-like workers (full-time with full-time, part-time with part-time) and accounting for factors such as employer size, industry, parenthood, and qualifications, researchers concluded the pay rise disparity reflects discrimination rather than differences in negotiating behavior. However, the study found that women and men under 40 ask for and receive pay rises at equal rates, suggesting negotiating behavior may be changing among younger workers.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The palm oil industry globally faces criticism for environmental destruction, deforestation, and labor practices, though executives argue policing third-party suppliers is industry-wide challenging and that enforcement is complicated by the economic benefits these firms provide to rural areas.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

A pilot scheme in Cwm Cynon and Neath Castle is targeting patients suspected by their GPs of having cancer but showing no clear signs or symptoms. This follows a visit by doctors to Denmark to study their diagnostic systems, which have improved cancer survival rates. The problem in Wales is that patients without clear symptoms wait too long for diagnosis because they don't fit neatly into specific treatment pathways, resulting in delayed referrals and multiple tests over weeks. The fear is that too many patients begin treatment when their cancer is advanced or incurable. Under the pilot, 40 GPs can refer suspected patients to a diagnostic centre at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days, with around six patients per week receiving various tests on the same day. Currently only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms receive diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital. The trials were developed following experts' return from Aarhus, Denmark, which established diagnostic centres due to concerns about cancer survival rates. The pilot aims to reassure patients and accelerate diagnosis.

The team lacks the intensity and pressing of last season, resulting in only four first-half goals in their first 10 games compared to 59 the previous year. Defensively, despite significant spending on players like Dejan Lovren, Liverpool remain inconsistent, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet lacks commanding presence.

Against Chelsea, Liverpool will need a solid defensive structure with attacking contributions from full-backs and creative midfielders, but Chelsea remain superior.

Architect Vaila Morrison notes that making them compulsory would provide clarity, as designers tend to focus on mandatory requirements and can ignore recommendations. Some venues like Arsenal Football Club have successfully installed Changing Places toilets and reported positive responses.

The economy relies on sugar and tourism but is diversified to include mining and services; however, persistent trade and budget deficits have made Fiji one of the world's largest per capita aid recipients.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The Electoral Commission attributed this to the lack of direct communication between local electoral registers and the online registration service, making it difficult for people to check if already registered. The watchdog recommended clearer information on registration sites, a verification function, and the ability for people registered in two constituencies to choose which one they'll vote in at general elections.

These convoys faced constant threats from German U-boats and aircraft, as well as severe cold, storms, and ice floes. By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels, with thousands of Allied seamen losing their lives. More than 3,000 men died during the campaign. The Russian Embassy initially intended to award survivors with the Medal of Ushakov in May 2012 as a symbol of gratitude, but the Foreign Office blocked this as it violated rules preventing British soldiers from receiving foreign medals more than five years after the fact. The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 to recognize the veterans. The Foreign Office eventually allowed an exception to its rules, and President Vladimir Putin presented the first Ushakov medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013. Able seaman Charles Lewis, 91, said he was \"honoured and delighted\" to receive the medal.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Key issues included delays in getting offenders to start work, insufficient enforcement when offenders failed to attend, and one case where an offender completed only 16 hours in 17 months. The inspection of 100 cases revealed that unpaid work was often viewed merely as punishment rather than a rehabilitation opportunity. While some high-quality management and instances of offenders gaining skills were noted, the report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement, including reducing unnecessary turndowns of offenders and creating work objectives tailored to individual circumstances. The Ministry of Justice accepted all recommendations and committed to implementing them, emphasizing the need for better enforcement and rehabilitation.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Born in 1946, his life changed after serving as a naval orderly during the Vietnam War, instilling in him a sense of urgency and determination to become a doctor. During his medical training, he excelled in research and became focused on decoding genes. In the 1980s at the National Institute of Health, he pioneered automated gene sequencing and developed a breakthrough method using RNA molecules instead of complete DNA blueprints, dramatically increasing gene sequence output. After leaving NIH in 1992, he founded The Institute for Genomic Research and unveiled the first complete genome of a free-living organism in 1995. His most significant challenge to the scientific establishment came in 1998 when he announced Celera Genomics would decode the human genome in three years, competing with the public project. Both published results in 2001. His commercial approach and data restrictions drew criticism, but provided him financial independence. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute to create synthetic life, resulting in the organism Synthia, published in Science. He has also conducted genetic research aboard his yacht Sorcerer II, collecting microbes from oceans. Venter believes synthetic microbes could spark an industrial revolution and help address environmental issues.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Modern school meals now comply with strict nutritional guidelines and offer healthier options than in the past. About 40% of primary school children and slightly fewer secondary school children in England eat school lunches, compared to 46% in Scotland.

While fishing communities voted heavily to leave the EU, hoping to regain control of UK waters, the report warns that the industry—which represents only 0.5% of GDP and employs 12,000 people—risks being marginalized in Brexit negotiations. Key complications include: most commercial fish stocks are in shared waters with other EU states; the vast majority of UK fish are exported to the EU while significant portions of fish consumed in Britain are imported; and continued market access may require allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters. The report recommends retaining elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, including science-based quotas, and notes that leaving the EU could create four separate fisheries management regimes across England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.

Curtis acknowledges the difficulty of the club's situation, noting that while relegation is possible, bouncing back from the Championship would be challenging despite examples like Norwich and Burnley. He attributes Swansea's decline to frequent managerial changes since Michael Laudrup's departure in 2014, stating the club has lost the \"Swansea Way\" that defined successful eras under Martinez, Rodgers, and Laudrup. Despite losing players without adequate replacements, Curtis believes the current squad can survive relegation and emphasizes to new signings the club's remarkable journey from near-bankruptcy and potential Football League relegation in 2003 to Premier League status in 2011.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Born in 1946, his determination to pursue science was shaped by his experience as a naval orderly during the Vietnam War. Working at the National Institute of Health in the 1980s, he revolutionized gene sequencing by focusing on messenger RNA rather than entire genomes, dramatically increasing speed. After leaving NIH in 1992, he founded The Institute for Genomic Research and later Celera Genomics in 1998, which raced against the public project to decode the human genome—both publishing results in 2001. His unconventional approach to data access drew criticism but provided him financial independence. In 2006, he established the J Craig Venter Institute to create synthetic life, resulting in the organism Synthia, published in Science. He has also conducted genetic research aboard his yacht Sorcerer II, collecting marine microbes. Venter believes synthetic microbes could spark an industrial revolution by producing desired materials and addressing environmental issues.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Since 2010, over half of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters aimed at those over 25. The report calls for radical expansion to 300,000 new starts annually, with the majority at level three or above for three years, and no more than 10% as two-year level two courses.

Barcelona faced investigation into the transfer after allegations that the actual cost was greater than the initially stated 57m euros. A Spanish judge ruled there was sufficient evidence to continue investigations. Barcelona denied any tax-related crime and made a complimentary tax declaration of 13,550,830.56 euros, maintaining they had met their original fiscal obligations. Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell resigned following accusations of misappropriating money related to the transfer. Neymar scored seven goals in 18 league appearances and three in seven Champions League matches for Barcelona that season.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Twenty-seven years later, DNA analysis led police to identify his mother, who was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. She revealed that she had concealed her pregnancy and delivered the stillborn baby herself, then placed his body in the pond. A second post-mortem found no evidence of foul play. The infanticide charge was dropped, though the Crown Prosecution Service is considering charges related to failing to register the birth and preventing lawful burial. The baby was reburied and named Peter after the church where he was laid to rest, with a new headstone provided by a stillbirth support charity.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Young mistakenly believed Hicks planned to leave without paying and drove him back to the taxi rank against his wishes. When Hicks jumped from the moving vehicle traveling at over 20mph, he suffered severe brain injuries, developed epilepsy, and now requires 24-hour care from his mother. A high court judge ruled Young had unlawfully imprisoned Hicks and was liable for damages, though the exact compensation amount—expected to be around 50 percent of the family's request and \"hundreds of thousands of pounds\"—will be determined at a further hearing. The judge applied a 50 percent reduction in damages due to Hicks' decision to jump from the moving car, plus an additional £250 for unlawful imprisonment.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The CDC defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. Researchers attribute the increases to changing social norms that make women's drinking more acceptable, younger populations more likely to binge drink, affluent individuals having more disposable income, decreased alcohol taxes in real dollars, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study tracked county-level drinking patterns among 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older and found that approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

However, scientific studies show women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than men, and male leaders throughout history have made poor decisions influenced by hormones. The passage argues that the real issue isn't hormones or biology, but rather deep-seated gender bias in the workplace and society. Women face both overt bias (such as corporate boards having more men named John, Robert, William, or James than total women) and covert bias (such as professors being described as \"geniuses\" versus \"nice\"). The passage contends that gender equality benefits everyone—companies with more female leaders are more profitable, involved fathers make children happier and more successful, and diverse teams produce better results. The article concludes that society must acknowledge and actively work to overcome gender bias rather than simply telling women they can achieve anything.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Available in various styles including denim, cropped, printed, and striped, this look has made a comeback since the seventies. To wear wide legs successfully, especially for shorter individuals, the key is pairing them with high-heeled shoes to elongate the leg and keeping the top half simple to maintain proportion. High-waisted, longer lengths also add leg length. Denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend, with designers like Gucci, Celine, and Stella McCartney featuring wide-leg styles on their SS15 runways. High street options include Topshop's Miller jean.

The author argues England should follow suit, allowing coach Stuart Lancaster to pick the best players regardless of where they play. Examples cited include Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell at Toulon, Steffon Armitage, and Nick Abendanon, whose performances have improved abroad. The author contends that restricting selection to domestic players is outdated and counterproductive, particularly for a home World Cup where England needs its strongest squad. Jonny Wilkinson's success in France is presented as precedent. The author argues that players deserve confidence they were selected on merit, not location, and that clubs benefit from a winning national team. The current policy is characterized as misguided and unnecessarily limiting England's chances of success.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

She argues that \"fat\" is simply an honest description of her physique, just like calling herself \"short\" or \"wife,\" and should not be synonymous with \"ugly.\" Lillian notes that society programs women to reject this label, citing a 66 percent rise in workplace size discrimination over 30 years and studies showing girls aged 11-17 wish to be thinner. However, research indicates that exposure to body diversity increases acceptance and preference for different body types. Through burlesque performance since 2012, Lillian aims to present a fuller figure in a positive, glamorous context to challenge societal beauty standards.

The map is the first in a series that will eventually provide a 3D view of dark matter across one-eighth of the night sky, covering 12.5 percent of the entire sky over five years. The map was created using data from the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device attached to the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, as part of the Dark Energy Survey led by Fermilab. Dark matter, which comprises at least 80 percent of matter in the universe, cannot be directly observed but its gravitational effects on galaxies can be mapped. The team analyzed 130 million telescope images of galaxies to construct the map, requiring supercomputers for the complex measurements. The research shows that galaxies form where dark matter concentrations are highest, with visible galaxies clustering near dark matter clumps and sparse regions containing few galaxies. The survey aims to better understand dark energy and test cosmological theories by comparing amounts of dark and visible matter.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

However, their popularity has dramatically collapsed due to several factors: the government's anti-corruption crackdown eliminated their use as bribes to officials, and weight restrictions banning dogs over 50 kg were implemented in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. As a result, hundreds of these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses for meat and leather, often stolen from streets or offloaded by breeders as poor-quality specimens. The breed's decline was also accelerated by over-breeding that deteriorated their quality and by urbanization making them unsuitable for city living.

They keep costs minimal by camping (their primary accommodation), using hosting websites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers, and purchasing inexpensive staples like pasta, bread, rice, eggs, and seasonal produce. Their journey began in London and has taken them through France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia.

After experiencing a headache following England's match against France, he pulled out of the Ireland game despite it being a major Six Nations fixture. Brown credits World Rugby's online concussion awareness modules with helping him recognize symptoms and make the responsible decision not to rush his recovery. He emphasizes the importance of understanding concussion dangers and being honest about symptoms, noting that increased awareness means players should not risk playing through potential concussion signs. Other players facing similar challenges include George North, who has been advised not to play this season after four concussions, and Johnny Sexton, who was stood down for 12 weeks.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Research shows that typical heterosexual couples now have sex three times per month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Professor David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University attributes this decline to the blurring of boundaries between public and private life, constant email checking, and increased busyness that leaves less quality time for partners. The constant connectivity means people remain mentally engaged with work and the outside world even at bedtime, causing sex to fall lower on their list of priorities.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Once commanding prices up to £1.2 million, they are now being sent to slaughterhouses for meat and leather. The decline is attributed to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which eliminated the practice of gifting these dogs to officials, and to weight restrictions (over 50 kg) imposed in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Poor breeding practices created a glut of low-quality dogs that cannot be sold. Additionally, rapid urbanization has made people realize the breed is unsuited to city living. Animal welfare workers have documented cruel conditions, including 20 mastiffs found in cramped cages with a third already dead and none fed for three days. Gangs are also stealing the dogs from streets to sell to slaughterhouses.","company":"anthropic","model_name":"claude-haiku-4-5","date_code":"20251001","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-16","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}
