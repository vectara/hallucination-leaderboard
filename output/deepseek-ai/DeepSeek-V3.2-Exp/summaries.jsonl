The research, which did not prove causation, suggested a possible mechanism where antibiotics kill gut bugs, freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite. The lead author warned that such antibiotic exposure may be a contributing factor to the childhood obesity epidemic and emphasized the need for judicious use of these drugs in infancy.

A new pilot scheme in Cynon Valley and Neath focuses on patients suspected of having cancer but without urgent symptoms, who often face long waits for diagnosis as they don't fit a specific treatment pathway. This leads to multiple tests over several weeks, risking treatment starting only after the cancer has advanced. The scheme allows 40 GPs to refer such patients to a diagnostic centre for various tests, aiming for same-day assessment and a diagnosis within seven days. Currently, only 35% of patients with \"worrying symptoms\" in the Cwm Taf area receive a diagnosis. A similar clinic will be established in Neath Port Talbot. The trials were developed after Welsh officials visited Denmark, which improved its cancer survival rates by establishing diagnostic centres. The goal is to provide peace of mind and a faster process, enabling earlier diagnosis. If the six-month Cynon Valley pilot is successful, other local health boards will offer the same service.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-30","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

To achieve this, Airbus has revolutionized satellite manufacturing by adopting high-volume, low-cost assembly line methods, aiming to produce satellites for under a million dollars each. The first assembly line is in Toulouse, with another planned in Florida. The satellites will be launched in large batches using over 20 Soyuz rockets, with the goal of having nearly 300 in orbit by late 2020/early 2021. OneWeb has raised $1.7bn and claims a first-mover advantage over competitors like SpaceX. The project is licensed by the UK Space Agency and has committed to aggressive debris mitigation, including de-orbiting satellites within two years and including hardware for potential active removal. While this new manufacturing model is disruptive, Airbus acknowledges that bespoke, \"gold-plated\" satellites will still be needed for specialized missions.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-30","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

Tablets are used in about 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, with the highest use in academies. The number of tablets in schools is expected to double between 2014 and 2016. While researchers cannot isolate technology as a cause for improved attainment, head teachers report a positive impact, including increased pupil motivation and family involvement. The study also highlights how immersed young people are in technology, with many using internet-connected devices in bed for social media. A separate study suggested touch-screen computers are useful for helping boys and poorer pupils learn to read. A head teacher advocate argues tablets create a sense of empowerment for pupils and prepare them for the modern world.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-30","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

It was constructed by analyzing the shapes of 130 million galaxies, using gravitational lensing to detect dark matter's invisible presence, which makes up most of the universe's matter. The map shows clumps of dark matter (red) and sparse regions (blue), aligning with visible galaxies and supporting theories of galaxy formation.
