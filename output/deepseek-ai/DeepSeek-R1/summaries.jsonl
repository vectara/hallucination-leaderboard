By age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls in the study were overweight or obese, with boys appearing particularly prone to weight gain after antibiotics. Boys given antibiotics were also slightly taller.\n4.  **Proposed Mechanism:** While the study did not prove causation, researchers suggested antibiotics might cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that normally consume some food (freeing up more calories) or by increasing appetite.\n5.  **Researcher's Conclusion & Warning:** The lead author stated antibiotic exposure before six months or repeatedly in infancy was associated with increased body mass. He warned this effect might contribute to the global childhood obesity epidemic and highlighted the \"crucial importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy.\"\n6.  **Broader Context:** The findings come amid concerns about antibiotic overuse, including links to other health issues (eczema, digestive problems) and the development of antibiotic resistance/superbugs."}

This surprised researchers and provided strong evidence that Varvara, previously thought to be an endangered western gray whale, might actually be an eastern gray whale.\n5.  **Conservation Implication:** The finding suggests some \"western\" gray whales might be eastern grays. With only about 150 western gray whales believed to exist, this could mean their population is even lower than thought. It also indicates a need to re-examine previous genetic studies differentiating the two groups."}

Specifically, they cited targeting hospitals and blocking humanitarian aid (including the September 19th convoy attack).\n3.  **Humanitarian Crisis in Aleppo:** Heavy aerial bombardment has occurred in Aleppo since the ceasefire ended two weeks ago, killing hundreds (including children) and trapping 250,000 people in the rebel-held east. A main trauma hospital was hit multiple times.\n4.  **Russia's Response:** Russia regretted the US decision. It denied involvement in the aid convoy attack (attributing it to ground fire) and accused the US of:\n    *   Failing to fulfill its key obligation to improve humanitarian conditions around Aleppo.\n    *   Failing to separate moderate opposition groups from jihadists.\n    *   Shifting blame for the collapse of the truce.\n5.  **Consequences:** The US recalled personnel intended for a potential US-Russian military coordination center and halted planned Geneva talks on coordinating strikes against jihadists.\n6.  **Ongoing Communication:** Despite the suspension, both sides will continue communication on counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid clashes."}

It was argued this could be the largest social house building programme since the 1970s.\n3.  **Scale of \"Expensive\" Stock:** 21.8% of UK social housing (816,000 properties worth up to £159bn) is classified as \"expensive\", with London alone having over £70bn worth. About 28,500 such properties become vacant annually.\n4.  **Government Support:** Downing Street backed the report, stating councils can already choose to do this and should use their stock efficiently. Selling high-value homes to fund more social housing was seen as something councils should consider. Housing Minister Grant Shapps supported a sell-off, citing government reforms and investment.\n5.  **Labour Opposition:** Labour strongly opposed the plan, arguing it would amount to \"social cleansing\" by driving low-income families out of whole neighbourhoods, breaking up mixed communities, and worsening the housing crisis. They proposed funding affordable homes via a bank bonus tax instead.\n6.  **Think Tank Justification:** Policy Exchange director Neil O'Brien argued no one has a \"right\" to live in the most expensive areas, and selling one expensive home could house two families on the waiting list, which he deemed fairer. The think tank claimed the policy would be popular.\n7.  **Criticisms:** Critics (including the National Housing Federation and Labour MP Karen Buck) warned the policy would push the less well-off out of affluent areas into \"ghettos\", creating segregated communities. Buck also noted cuts to previous housing programmes."}

At its peak, it housed nearly all national papers and was considered the pinnacle of a journalist's career.\n2.  **End of an Era:** The closure of the Sunday Post's London office marks the departure of the last two journalists (Darryl Smith and Gavin Sherriff) working on Fleet Street itself, symbolizing the end of its journalistic era.\n3.  **Peak Importance:** During its heyday (before widespread television and social media), Fleet Street was crucial, providing about 85% of public information. It had a distinct culture, characterized by busy newsrooms, pubs filled with journalists, and a male-dominated environment with notable sexism (e.g., El Vino bar refusing women).\n4.  **Decline Trigger:** The decline began decisively in 1986 when Rupert Murdoch moved his newspapers (Sun, News of the World, Times, Sunday Times) to Wapping, adopting new computerized printing technology and breaking union resistance. Most other national papers followed by 1988.\n5.  **Transformation:** The former newspaper buildings on Fleet Street have been repurposed for other businesses (e.g., Sainsbury's headquarters, Pizza Express).\n6.  **Personal Reflections:** Reporters Smith and Sherriff shared personal memories of the street's vibrant past (typewriters, pubs, printing presses) contrasting with its current state.

Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely to be involved in violent crime than affluent girls, even after accounting for other factors.\n3.  **Gender & Violence:** Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts on average.\n4.  **Poverty & Outcomes:** Household poverty is a key factor increasing the likelihood of young people offending and exacerbates other risks. Poorer young people are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. A history of police contact is the strongest predictor of being not in education, employment, or training (NEET) by age 18.\n5.  **Victimization & Perpetration:** People living in extreme poverty are much more likely to be both victims and perpetrators of crime.\n6.  **Study Details:** These findings come from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime (tracking 4,300 young people since 1998) by the University of Edinburgh, published in Scottish Justice Matters.\n7.  **Researcher Conclusion:** Researchers state a \"destructive dynamic\" exists: poverty increases violence risk, and contact with the juvenile justice system inadvertently worsens the conditions for violence.\n8.  **Crime Rate Inequality:** Despite falling overall crime rates in Scotland, the reduction has not benefited areas with the most chronic crime. Half of the highest crime communities are in the top 20% for chronic health problems, and a third are in the top 20% for unemployment. Crime remains highly concentrated in poor communities and among poor people.\n9.  **Government Response:** The Scottish government states Scotland is becoming safer (citing record low crime, homicide, and extra officers) and highlights initiatives like a £296m investment to counter UK welfare cuts and protect the vulnerable.

Long-range maritime patrol aircraft (like the French Atlantique used here) are also crucial assets.\n5.  **UK Defence Gap:** The exercise underscores a significant vulnerability in Britain's defences: the UK lacks its own maritime patrol aircraft. This gap forces reliance on allies when Russian submarines are reported near UK waters and creates a \"key vulnerability,\" potentially allowing Russia to track the UK's nuclear deterrent undetected.\n6.  **Russian Threat:** Russia is portrayed as possessing technologically advanced, \"quietest in the world\" submarines with highly skilled crews, making them NATO's \"most challenging adversary\" in this domain. NATO rarely comments on specific Russian sub sightings.\n7.  **Overall Message:** While the exercise aims to ensure NATO readiness for anti-submarine warfare, it also demonstrates that some member nations, particularly Britain, cannot effectively counter this threat alone due to capability gaps.

They are unlikely to be villages (few artefacts found) or defensive structures. Instead, they were probably used only sporadically, perhaps as ritual gathering places.\n4.  **Key Difference:** Unlike other ritual sites (e.g., Maya pyramids, Stonehenge), soil analysis (phytoliths, charcoal, carbon isotopes) indicates they were built amongst taller vegetation and likely not visible above the forest canopy, raising questions about their purpose.\n5.  **Environmental Impact:** The research challenges the view of pristine pre-European Amazon forests. Evidence suggests humans managed the environment over 6,000 years by concentrating valuable tree species (like palms) instead of large-scale burning, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products.\n6.  **Legacy:** There is \"tantalizing evidence\" that the biodiversity of Acre's remaining forests may still retain a strong legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices."}

Only UKIP and the DUP commit to maintaining 2%. Falling below risks damaging credibility with the US.\n4.  **Future Budget Cuts:** Further defence cuts are likely as no major party (Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems) has ring-fenced the MoD's £34bn budget. The MoD is vulnerable to significant savings targets (£2-3bn annually) under deficit reduction plans.\n5.  **Trident Renewal Debate:** Renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent (estimated £20bn) is a major point of contention.

The target is nearly 300 satellites by end-2020/early-2021, over 600 a year later, and over 800 by mid-decade.\n5.  **Competition & Advantage:** While other companies (SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat) plan constellations, OneWeb/Airbus believe they have a first-mover advantage. $1.7 billion in equity has been raised, with loan talks ongoing.\n6.  **UK Connection:** OneWeb is registered in the UK's Channel Islands, licensed by the UK Space Agency (UKSA), and expects significant economic benefits for the UK.\n7.  **Debris Mitigation:** Addressing concerns about space junk, OneWeb commits to de-orbiting satellites within two years using extra hardware and adapter devices for potential removal by chase vehicles if they fail."}

The Scottish discretionary budget is projected to be 12.5% lower by 2019-20 than in 2010-11, with £1bn in cuts still to come. Swinney argues these cuts were unnecessary for reducing debt/deficit. Despite this, the Scottish government is determined to protect key priorities like schools, hospitals, and police, citing past successes in these areas.\n2.  **UK Government's Response:** Contradicts Swinney, stating the Scottish government will have £390m more spending available next year (rising to £750m including underspend). They emphasize the stability provided by the UK block grant (almost £30bn) and argue this is a better deal than independence, especially given low oil prices. They urge the Scottish government to focus on new powers rather than \"grievance\".\n3.  **Labour's Response (Jackie Baillie):** Criticizes Swinney's \"anti-austerity posturing\" as lacking substance ahead of the budget. Accuses the SNP of planning \"pre-election giveaways now and cuts later\" and calls for a long-term budget. Labour promises a \"real alternative to austerity\" with different tax decisions compared to both the Tories and the SNP."}

There are currently 893 in the UK, but over 250,000 people potentially require them.\n3.  **Campaign for Change:** Campaigners (like Lorna Fillingham, who started a petition) are calling for Changing Places toilets to be made *compulsory* in the building regulations for larger new complexes (shopping centres, cinemas, stadiums), as current guidelines (BS 8300:2009) only *recommend* them.\n4.  **Impact of Lack:** The absence of these facilities causes significant psychological distress, making families feel isolated, undervalued, and unable to participate in outings.\n5.  **Benefits & Successes:** Installing Changing Places toilets (e.g., at Arsenal Football Club and Cardiff's Principality Stadium) greatly improves accessibility and quality of life for users and their families, enabling participation in activities.\n6.  **Challenges:** Making them compulsory in existing buildings faces logistical and financial barriers due to the significant space requirement. The campaign therefore focuses on new large complexes."}

He acted because he found the extent of US surveillance \"horrifying,\" while US officials called the leaks \"extremely damaging\" to national security.\n2.  **Revelations:**\n    *   The NSA had massive access to individuals' chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers, and social networking data.\n    *   The US government confirmed requesting millions of Verizon phone records, including call duration, location, and numbers.\n    *   The Prism program allegedly provided \"backdoor\" access to servers of nine major tech companies (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple), potentially accessing private posts, chats, and searches.

This issue persisted from the EU referendum.\n2.  **System Disconnect:** The core cause is the lack of connection between local council electoral registers and the central online registration system, preventing identification of duplicates.\n3.  **Scale of Duplication:** Of 4.9 million applications submitted online between Dec 2016 and May 2017, the net increase was only 1.4 million, indicating 30-70% were likely duplicates. This caused significant administrative and financial burdens.\n4.  **High Turnout & Registration:** A record 46.8 million people were registered for the June 2017 election, with 68.7% turnout (highest since 1997). There was a surge in applications after the snap election announcement.\n5.  **Proposed Solutions:** The Commission recommended:\n    *   Better integration of local registers.\n    *   Clearer online information and a verification function (like Australia/New Zealand/Ireland) to check registration status.\n    *   Allowing cross-checks across the 381 separate registers to prevent double voting.\n    *   Requiring people registered in two constituencies to choose one for general elections.\n6.  **Labour's Concerns:** While agreeing double voting is a serious offence, Labour warned against solutions like a blanket ban on dual registration, arguing it would disenfranchise students and others who legitimately need to be registered at two addresses (e.g., for work/study) and could make it harder for young people to register.\n7.  **Lack of Evidence for Double Voting:** The Commission found no evidence to support social media claims of actual double voting but stressed it takes the issue seriously."}

War\" was initiated by murdered opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and completed by his colleagues, led by Ilya Yashin.\n2.  **Content & Purpose:** It compiles facts already reported in media since 2014 (Crimea annexation, eastern Ukraine conflict) to systematically accuse President Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own political ends, highlighting the human and economic costs.\n3.  **Key Accusation:** It directly contradicts Russia's official stance (denying regular troop deployment, calling fighters \"volunteers\"). The report asserts that Russian army units were decisive in securing all major rebel victories in Donetsk and Luhansk, with soldiers admitting they were directed into Ukraine.\n4.  **Evidence Presented:** Includes testimonies from soldiers admitting Russian generals directed battles, documentation of military units, photos of weaponry (though harder to verify), details on soldier salaries ($2,000-3,000/month), and an estimated Russian spending figure (53bn roubles).\n5.  **Motivation & Context:** Nemtsov began the report after learning relatives of dead Russian soldiers were denied promised compensation (though these relatives remain silent and scared). The opposition accuses Putin of masterminding the war to boost his popularity, admitting this strategy was successful.\n6.  **Challenges:** Publishing and distributing the report is difficult due to publisher fear. An initial print run is only 2,000 copies, and there's a question about public interest in facts already available online/liberal media. Some Russians accept the involvement as support for independence from Kiev.\n7.  **Historical Precedent:** The report may face the same fate as Nemtsov's previous critical reports (on Putin's corruption and Sochi Olympics costs), which were accurate but failed to galvanize protests."}

Despite criticism of his personality and wealth, his efforts undeniably sped up the process.\n2.  **Synthetic Life (Synthia):** After the human genome, Venter focused on creating synthetic life. After over a decade of work at his J. Craig Venter Institute, his team created \"Synthia,\" the first synthetic organism, detailed in the journal *Science*.\n3.  **Background & Motivation:** Venter was not scholarly as a youth. His experience as a Navy medic during the Vietnam War's Tet offensive profoundly changed him, instilling a determination to become a doctor and a strong sense of urgency about not wasting time.\n4.  **Scientific Breakthroughs & Methods:**\n    *   Excelled in medical research over practice.\n    *   At the NIH, he recognized the importance of decoding genes but found the process slow.\n    *   Adopted automated decoding machines in 1987.\n    *   Made a key breakthrough by focusing on RNA (messenger molecules) to find active genes rapidly instead of the entire genome, enabling unprecedented gene sequencing rates.\n5.  **Conflict & Private Institutes:** His rapid methods drew criticism (e.g., from James Watson) and loss of public funding. This prompted him to leave the NIH in 1992 to found The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). In 1995, TIGR published the first complete genome of a free-living organism (*Haemophilus influenzae*).\n6.  **Celera Genomics:** In 1998, he formed Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome in just 3 years, directly competing with the public project. Both published results in 2001. His commercial approach and disregard for conventions like open data access brought further opprobrium but also significant financial rewards.\n7.  **J. Craig Venter Institute & Other Projects:** He formed the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2006 to spearhead synthetic life creation. He also conducted a global ocean voyage on his yacht, *Sorcerer II*, collecting microbes for large-scale genome sequencing to understand gene evolution and function.\n8.  **Vision for Synthetic Biology:** Venter anticipated controversy over Synthia but believed synthetic microbes could create a \"new industrial revolution\" by producing useful materials, weaning society off oil, and capturing carbon dioxide to reverse environmental damage."}

Southern massifs (like Belledonne and Ecrins) experienced much greater losses than northern ones (like Mont Blanc).\n6.  **Reason for Disparity:** The lesser retreat in the north is attributed to higher mountain elevations and different climatic conditions (more precipitation and cloud cover).\n7.  **Specific Example:** France's largest glacier, La Mer de Glace (Mont Blanc), decreased only slightly from 31.5 sq km to just over 30 sq km.\n8.  **Broader Context:** This retreat mirrors accelerating ice loss reported in other parts of the Alps."}

He believes the Championship is stronger now and it would be very difficult for Swansea to bounce back immediately, citing the difficulty compared to clubs like Norwich, Burnley, or Newcastle.\n4.  **Swansea's History:** The passage notes Swansea's remarkable rise from near bankruptcy and almost dropping out of the Football League (2003) to Premier League promotion (2011), establishing a reputation for exciting, possession-based football (\"the Swansea Way\").\n5.  **Loss of Identity:** Curtis believes the club has lost its way since Michael Laudrup left in 2014, attributing this to frequent managerial changes and a dilution of the \"Swansea Way,\" questioning if key players have been adequately replaced.\n6.  **Current Squad & Motivation:** Despite the challenges, Curtis believes the current squad is good enough to stay up.

Frustrated by slow gene decoding, he adopted automated machines and then made a breakthrough by focusing on RNA messenger molecules instead of the entire DNA genome, dramatically speeding up gene sequencing.\n3.  **Human Genome Project & Controversy:** Venter turned the mapping of the human genome into a competitive race by forming Celera Genomics, aiming to finish in 3 years versus the public project's 10-year timeline. This approach, including perceived disregard for open data conventions, brought him significant criticism and vilification from parts of the scientific community. Both projects published results in 2001.\n4.  **Wealth & Independence:** His methods led to substantial financial rewards, giving him unusual independence to pursue science without relying on traditional public funding.\n5.  **Synthetic Life:** After the human genome, Venter focused on creating synthetic life. His institute (J. Craig Venter Institute) worked for over a decade, successfully creating an organism named Synthia, published in *Science*. This breakthrough was also controversial.\n6.  **Other Projects:** He conducted a global ocean expedition on his yacht, *Sorcerer II*, to sequence marine microbial genomes.\n7.  **Vision for Synthetic Biology:** Venter believed synthetic microbes could create a \"new industrial revolution,\" potentially reducing oil dependence and environmental damage by capturing CO2."}

Only 200,000 out of 520,000 annual starts are Level 3 (A-level equivalent), and just 20% of employers offer them (vs. 51% in Germany).\n2.  **Focus on Older Workers:** Since 2010, 58% of apprenticeships have been below Level 3, and three-quarters have been aimed at those over 25, often already in work.\n3.  **Shortage for Young People:** Only 61,000 new starts were for young people, leading to intense competition (11 young people per apprenticeship). Germany has 570,000 new apprenticeships for youngsters, 90% at A-level equivalent.\n4.  **Complex System:** England's vocational system is described as a \"complicated patchwork\" with 18,000 qualifications (vs. 330 in Germany), confusing employers and offering qualifications of \"little worth\".\n5.  **Key Recommendations:** The report calls for a radical expansion to 300,000 new apprenticeships annually.

His family plans to return to Canada in 2018 when one daughter finishes A-levels and another completes GCSEs, to utilize the Canadian education system. He stated the role requires \"total attention and devotion\" and managing his personal circumstances was the key factor.\n3.  **Professional Context:** While Carney recognized the professional challenge of leaving during the Brexit negotiations (expected to be underway in 2018), and understood an extension could provide market certainty, these were secondary to the personal reasons. He felt he could only extend by one year beyond the family's planned 2018 departure.\n4.  **Dismissal of Other Theories:** The passage explicitly dismisses speculation that the decision was due to political pressure, disillusionment with Brexit economic predictions, or tension with the Prime Minister (who wanted him to stay until 2021). Criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum forecasts also did not influence him.\n5.  **Timing:** The one-year extension allows him to stay until the expected completion of the Article 50 process decoupling the UK from the EU, after which a new Governor will take over."}

APC won most northern states and retained Lagos.\n4.  **APC's Oil State Challenge:** APC failed to win any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, raising concerns for President-elect Buhari about potential oil revenue disruption by militants and lack of cooperation from PDP governors there.\n5.  **Violence & Process:** The elections were marred by violence (66 incidents reported, higher than the presidential poll), especially in Rivers and other southern states, though overall more peaceful than previous years. Results for Taraba are outstanding, and Imo was declared inconclusive. Elections were not held in seven states.\n6.  **Significance:** When Buhari takes office, it will be the first time since 1999 that the president's party controls Lagos. The PDP faces a need for introspection and rebuilding after 16 years in power, impacted by defections, corruption allegations, and failure to tackle the northern insurgency."}

Previously, this protection did not apply to backups, allowing attackers with a password to download them even if two-step verification was enabled elsewhere.\n3.  **How Two-Step Verification Works:** After entering their username and password on a new device, users must also enter a four-digit code sent to a trusted phone number or via the Find My iPhone app. Without this code, access to iCloud and purchases is blocked.\n4.  **Recovery Key:** Users can generate a 14-character recovery key to regain access if they lose their trusted device, but must keep it safe.\n5.  **Effectiveness & Acknowledgement:** Elcomsoft's owner confirmed the update blocks his software's previous method and secures the process, also noting the new email notification for backup downloads.

He believes his well-rounded MMA skills (striking, takedowns) give him a significant advantage, especially on the ground, and that Machida has limited paths to victory on the feet.\n3.  **Rockhold's Respect:** Rockhold respects Machida as one of the best and longest-tenured top fighters, acknowledging his unique style and martial arts code.\n4.  **Rockhold's Preparation:** He has trained specifically to chase Machida down, including running marathons.\n5.  **Machida's Confidence & Stakes:** Machida is confident he can win by applying his style and technique, believing the winner deserves a title shot.

The sound of the propellers hitting the runway was described as unforgettable.\n3.  **Pilot Action:** Realizing the mistake, the pilot (Chris Georgaklis, 85) applied full throttle, causing the propellers to impact the runway a second time. Despite this, the engines stayed running.\n4.  **Recovery & Safe Landing:** The pilot managed to take off again from the runway and flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where he landed safely. He was accompanied by his dog, Buddy, and had nearly 50 years of flying experience.\n5.  **Cause:** Gear-up landings are most commonly caused by human error (forgetting to deploy gear) or mechanical failure.\n6.  **Investigation:** The FAA is investigating the incident."}

Consequently, Italy is withdrawing the European Arrest Warrant.\n6.  **Result:** Rancadore will be discharged from the extradition proceedings and allowed to remain in the UK with his family. The UK court needs to formally approve this once paperwork is complete.\n7.  **Criticism:** The lengthy extradition process faced criticism as a waste of time and money, especially since the CPS admitted an administrative error caused delays, and the sentence expiry meant extradition became impossible from October 2014 onwards.

She had declined to see them for decades, even after the killer's conviction, but regretted that decision and persisted in viewing them last year despite the investigator's attempts to dissuade her. The photos caused her intense anger and a desire for revenge.\n2.  **The Crime:** Marcia Trimble Ritter was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975. Her body was found 33 days after she disappeared, 150 yards from her home, hidden under a shower curtain and a child's wading pool. She had been strangled, sexually assaulted, had a fractured neck bone, vomit on her, partially pulled-out hair, blood on her scalp, and her cookie money was missing. This became Nashville's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years.\n3.  **The Perpetrator & Conviction:** Jerome Sidney Barrett was arrested in 2006 after DNA from Marcia's clothing matched his (a match made while he was in custody for another murder). Barrett had been in prison for sex crimes between 1974 and 2002, except for about a year when Marcia disappeared. In 2009, he was found guilty of second-degree murder for Marcia's death and sentenced to 44 years in prison."}

Changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink like men are cited as a key reason.\n3.  **Definitions:** Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women or two for men in the past month. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women or five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n4.  **Prevalence:** In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. County-level variations exist (e.g., binge drinking ranged from 6% to 36%).\n5.  **Contributing Factors:** Experts cite several factors: changing social norms, young people and affluent individuals being more likely to binge drink, tech industry culture in areas like the Bay Area, alcohol becoming cheaper relative to inflation due to stagnant taxes, increased alcohol advertising, and weakening alcohol control policies.\n6.  **Health Impact:** Alcohol was attributed to 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually.

They cannot own property, vote in state elections, or work in state government jobs. This has trapped generations in \"abject poverty\".\n3.  **Reason for Denial:** Successive state governments refused to grant rights due to fears of upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state, which has special constitutional autonomy. A pre-independence law also restricts citizenship.\n4.  **New Hope:** The recent electoral success and entry into government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kashmir has raised hopes among WPRs. The BJP has pledged to normalize their status.\n5.  **Activist Stance:** WPR activists state that granting \"state-subject rights\" is essential to improve their condition but warn they are ready to \"take matters into their own hands\" and \"spill our blood on the streets\" if their hopes are dashed again.\n6.  **Broader Context:** The WPRs' plight exists within the long-standing conflict over Kashmir, involving territorial disputes with Pakistan and rebel violence. Despite Kashmir being relatively prosperous, the WPRs remain impoverished."}

Not doing so risks failure and \"what ifs\".\n4.  **Examples of Overseas Success:** The passage cites several players whose performances improved significantly after moving overseas (Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Steffon Armitage, Nick Abendanon, Jonny Wilkinson) as proof that players can develop better abroad and should be selectable.\n5.  **Impact on England:** It argues that England's current policy weakens the team by excluding top talent like Armitage and Abendanon, potentially leading to defeat (e.g., against Australia with Giteau and Mitchell).

Crossing from Greece to Turkey symbolized entering Asia.\n7.  **Future Plans:** They plan to continue through Asia, cross the Pacific, and cycle the length of the American continents, expecting to be on the road for years."}
