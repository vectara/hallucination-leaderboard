A history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of whether a young person is not in education, employment, or training by age 18. The study, which has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, also identified gender as a significant predictor of violence, with boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts.

The findings include over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest until deforestation revealed them. These mysterious sites, likely used sporadically as ritual gathering places, are not understood to be villages or defensive structures. Soil analysis suggests the geoglyphs were built in taller vegetation, raising questions about their visibility and purpose. The research also indicates that prehistoric humans transformed the Amazonian environment through selective cultivation of economically valuable trees, rather than burning large tracts of forest, and that some remaining forests may retain a legacy of these ancient practices.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Defense is seen as a low concern for voters, overshadowed by the economy, healthcare, and immigration. The UK's military has been reduced in size, and the country has fallen in global defense spending rankings. Despite calls for increased defense spending, the UK is unlikely to meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP. The Ministry of Defence faces budget cuts, and there is uncertainty about the future of the Trident nuclear deterrent. The passage highlights the challenges of maintaining a capable military with limited resources and the potential for further cuts, which could impact the UK's global military presence and credibility.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The report suggests retaining many elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and maintaining scientific advice in setting quotas, but warns of the possibility of four different fisheries management regimes in the UK if the CFP framework is abandoned.

This retreat is attributed to lower mountain elevations and differing climatic conditions in the south compared to the north, where glaciers like La Mer de Glace have shown less significant loss.

It highlights a CEO's belief that women's hormones make them unsuitable for high-stakes decisions, contrasting this with historical examples of male leaders whose hormones led to poor decisions. The text also points out that women leaders tend to take fewer risks and that studies show women are less likely to engage in unethical behavior. Despite this, there is a broader discussion about gender bias in the workplace, which can limit women's opportunities and success. The passage emphasizes that while women are increasingly represented in education and the workforce, they still face significant bias that can affect their careers and leadership roles. It concludes by noting that gender equality benefits everyone, leading to stronger companies, healthier families, and more successful marriages.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}
