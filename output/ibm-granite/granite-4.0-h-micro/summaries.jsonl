The researchers suggest that antibiotics, commonly used to promote weight gain in farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study, which compared over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with antibiotic prescription records, found that by age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who received antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with boys showing a greater tendency for weight gain and slightly increased height. While the study does not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it highlights the potential role of antibiotics in the global childhood obesity epidemic and emphasizes the need for cautious antibiotic use in infancy.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The managers warn that blocking these changes could hinder England's football development and make it harder to win the World Cup, as the pool of English talent at the top level is shrinking.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with girls from poorer households being twice as likely to engage in violent crime. The study also found that a history of police involvement is a strong predictor of young people not being in education, employment, or training by age 18, and that poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The researchers concluded that household poverty exacerbates the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study, which tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, highlights a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risks of violence and contact with the juvenile justice system further perpetuates these conditions. The findings suggest that crime remains highly concentrated in poor communities and neighborhoods, despite overall crime rates being at a 41-year low in Scotland. The Scottish government has acknowledged the issue and is investing in initiatives to address poverty and inequality.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Oliver fired into a car as it drove away from the party, killing Edwards and injuring four others, including two of Edwards' brothers. The incident occurred after officers entered the home to find the owner, believing they heard gunshots outside. However, footage later showed the car driving forward, not aggressively towards the officer. Oliver was subsequently fired for policy violations and charged with murder and aggravated assault. The county's district attorney stated that justice is being pursued effectively. If convicted, Oliver would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas County since 1973. His lawyer has not commented, and no trial date has been set. The Edwards family's lawyer, Lee Merritt, noted that a murder indictment for Oliver is appropriate, but emphasized the rarity of such convictions for police officers in Texas.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" were found, concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest until recent deforestation. The purpose of these mysterious sites remains unclear, but they are likely not villages or defensive structures, as few artifacts were found and their layout doesn't suggest defensive reasons. Instead, they may have been used sporadically as ritual gathering places, similar to Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. The geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, which raises questions about their purpose. The research suggests that the Amazonian forests were not pristine before European arrival, but rather, humans transformed the environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products. There is evidence that some of Acre's remaining forests may still retain a legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

While the industry only contributes 0.5% to GDP and employs 12,000 people, it is crucial not to be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which includes quotas and equal access for EU member states, has been criticized for its negative impact on Britain. The report suggests that a successful post-Brexit fishing industry would require continued market access, but this may come with trade-offs, such as EU member states demanding more access to UK waters. The report also emphasizes the need to retain elements of the CFP and ensure scientific advice guides total allowable catches and quotas. Many in the fishing industry see Brexit as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, similar to Norway. The EU recently agreed on new quotas under the CFP, which the industry believes is a positive development.

The report, titled \"Putin. War,\" is based on facts from Russian and foreign media since Crimea's annexation in 2014 and the conflict's outbreak. It alleges that Russian soldiers and equipment were crucial in securing victories for pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, contradicting Russia's denial of sending regular troops. The report also highlights the financial aspect of the conflict, estimating Russian spending at 53 billion roubles ($1 billion). Nemtsov's work was motivated by the lack of promised compensation to families of deceased Russian soldiers. Despite the report's compelling evidence, publishing and distributing it proved challenging due to publishers' reluctance and the question of public interest in the facts.

First Minister Carwyn Jones expressed frustration that he did not see the letter before its publication and that his administration was not involved in its drafting, criticizing the lack of respect shown towards the devolved administrations. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns defended the government's actions, stating that the prime minister had visited Wales multiple times and that the UK government is committed to acting in the best interests of the entire UK, including Wales. The letter mentioned by the UK government promises to consult on the distribution of powers between Westminster and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with the expectation that this will lead to an increase in decision-making power for each administration. However, the specific powers to be transferred and the associated funding remain unclear, with some suggesting that the lack of clarity may lead to political challenges.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

This trend is part of a broader pattern of glacier retreat observed in other Alpine regions across several European nations. The research, led by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie, utilized historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs to assess the condition of roughly 600 glaciers in the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the Mont Blanc Massif. The study highlights that the retreat is more pronounced in the southern sectors of the Alps, with glaciers in the Belledonne and Ecrins massifs showing particularly severe reductions. Factors contributing to this disparity include lower elevations and different climatic conditions in the southern Alps, such as higher precipitation and cloud cover. The northern Alps, including the famous La Mer de Glace glacier, have experienced less dramatic retreat. The findings underscore the ongoing challenges in monitoring and assessing glacier health across the Alpine region, with similar trends reported in Switzerland.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

While the industry only contributes 0.5% to GDP and employs 12,000 people, it must not be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been criticized for disadvantaging Britain, but Brexit presents a chance for the industry to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the report warns that EU member states may demand more access to UK waters, potentially leading to four different fisheries management regimes. The industry argues that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats, with the EU recently announcing new quotas under the CFP, which are seen as favorable for the UK. The government emphasizes the importance of ensuring British companies have maximum freedom to trade in the single market while reviewing fisheries management for fair access to quota and sustainable stocks.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

After the human genome's publication, he shifted focus to creating a synthetic life form, resulting in the development of Synthia, an organism published in Science. Born in 1946, Venter initially pursued surfing in Southern California before joining the Vietnam War, which instilled a sense of urgency and a commitment to medicine. His medical training led him to the US National Institute of Health, where he recognized the potential of automated decoding machines to accelerate gene sequencing. Leaving the NIH in 1992, Venter founded The Institute for Genomic Research and later Celera Genomics in 1995, which announced the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. In 1998, he formed Celera Genomics to complete the human genome in three years, a project that published its results in 2001. Despite controversy over his methods and disregard for scientific conventions, Venter's financial success allowed him to pursue his scientific goals independently. In 2006, he established the J Craig Venter Institute to create the world's first synthetic life form. Venter's work has also included oceanographic projects to sequence microbial genomes from the sea, aiming to advance understanding of gene and protein functions and potentially revolutionize industrial processes.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The PDP's decline is evident in their loss of key northern states and control of Adamawa, a state affected by Boko Haram insurgency. However, they retained Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP only won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. The APC's victory is notable as they failed to win in Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could be a concern for Buhari due to potential oil disruptions. The elections were generally more peaceful than previous years, but violence and ethnic conflicts occurred in some areas. The PDP will need to undergo introspection and rebuild under a new leader.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Women with BRCA1 mutations face a high risk of both breast and ovarian cancer, with a lifetime risk of breast cancer up to 70%. The study found that oophorectomy reduced the risk of breast cancer death by 62% in BRCA1 mutation carriers, and a 65% reduction in overall mortality. The protective effect of oophorectomy was evident immediately after diagnosis and lasted for 15 years. The authors recommend further research, particularly on women who undergo the procedure within a year of breast cancer diagnosis, and for those with the BRCA2 variant.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, highlights that the increase in binge drinking is largely driven by women's changing social norms and increased access to alcohol, particularly among affluent individuals in urban areas. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who consume any alcohol has remained relatively stable.
