The researchers suggest that antibiotics, commonly used to promote weight gain in farm animals, may also contribute to childhood obesity. The study, which compared over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with antibiotic prescription records, found that by age two, one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese. Children who received antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, with boys showing a greater tendency for weight gain and slightly increased height. While the study does not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it highlights the potential role of antibiotics in the global childhood obesity epidemic and emphasizes the need for cautious antibiotic use in infancy.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The managers warn that blocking these changes could hinder England's football development and make it harder to win the World Cup, as the pool of English talent at the top level is shrinking.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The charity Fresh Start Housing refers clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agency makes money by housing unrelated people in one property and claiming housing benefit for each person, resulting in higher benefit payouts than the rent passed to landlords. Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making it highly profitable. However, the arrangement has been criticized as \"a new low\" by a homeless group. One tenant, Nigel McCann, described the properties as unsuitable and had to remove 28 bags of rubbish to make them habitable. The company's owner, Samir Patel, maintains that Fresh Start Housing is an independent charity and that the majority of properties are sourced from private sector landlords. The Department for Communities and Local Government stated that local authorities are responsible for safeguarding taxpayers' money.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Living in poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with girls from poorer households being twice as likely to engage in violent crime. The study also found that a history of police involvement is a strong predictor of young people not being in education, employment, or training by age 18, and that poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. The researchers concluded that household poverty exacerbates the likelihood of young people offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study, which tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, highlights a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risks of violence and contact with the juvenile justice system further perpetuates these conditions. The findings suggest that crime remains highly concentrated in poor communities and neighborhoods, despite overall crime rates being at a 41-year low in Scotland. The Scottish government has acknowledged the issue and is investing in initiatives to address poverty and inequality.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Over 450 large geometrical \"geoglyphs\" were found, concealed by bamboo-dominated rainforest until recent deforestation. The purpose of these mysterious sites remains unclear, but they are likely not villages or defensive structures, as few artifacts were found and their layout doesn't suggest defensive reasons. Instead, they may have been used sporadically as ritual gathering places, similar to Maya pyramids or Britain's Stonehenge. The geoglyphs were built among taller vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, which raises questions about their purpose. The research suggests that the Amazonian forests were not pristine before European arrival, but rather, humans transformed the environment by concentrating on economically valuable trees, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products. There is evidence that some of Acre's remaining forests may still retain a legacy of these ancient \"agroforestry\" practices.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The UK's defense budget is projected to fall below the NATO threshold of 2%, and the size of the regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. The Royal Navy has 19 warships, and the RAF has 8 front-line fast jet squadrons. The UK lacks Maritime Patrol Aircraft and relies on NATO allies for submarine detection. Military analysts predict that defense spending will fall to 1.7% of GDP by the end of the decade, and the UK may need an additional £25bn over the next five years to meet the 2% target. The Conservatives, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats have not committed to protecting defense spending, and the military is concerned about further cuts.

To achieve this, Airbus is implementing a revolutionary, high-volume, low-cost assembly line method for satellite manufacturing, similar to car and plane production, in Toulouse, France, and Florida. The first 10 satellites are set to launch in April, with more launches planned throughout 2020 and 2021, eventually reaching over 800 satellites by the middle of the decade. This ambitious project requires a significant increase in rocket launches, with over 20 Soyuz vehicles booked. While other companies like SpaceX, Boeing, and ViaSat are also planning mega-constellations, OneWeb aims to have a first-mover advantage due to its commercial approach. The UK Space Agency is a key player, as OneWeb's revenues will flow through the UK, and the company is committed to debris mitigation, aiming to de-orbit redundant satellites within five years.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

While the industry only contributes 0.5% to GDP and employs 12,000 people, it is crucial not to be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which includes quotas and equal access for EU member states, has been criticized for its negative impact on Britain. The report suggests that a successful post-Brexit fishing industry would require continued market access, but this may come with trade-offs, such as EU member states demanding more access to UK waters. The report also emphasizes the need to retain elements of the CFP and ensure scientific advice guides total allowable catches and quotas. Many in the fishing industry see Brexit as an opportunity to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, similar to Norway. The EU recently agreed on new quotas under the CFP, which the industry believes is a positive development. The government has stated its intention to ensure British companies have maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market while reviewing fisheries management for fair access to quota, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The Leave campaign attributes the pound's drop to its retreat to March levels, while the Remain camp sees it as a result of falling chances of a Remain vote and global economic concerns. The pound has fallen 0.2% against the dollar, 0.6% against the euro, and 1% against the yen. Analysts predict that upcoming polls and hedge fund bets may further increase sterling's volatility.

The report, titled \"Putin. War,\" is based on facts from Russian and foreign media since Crimea's annexation in 2014 and the conflict's outbreak. It alleges that Russian soldiers and equipment were crucial in securing victories for pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, contradicting Russia's denial of sending regular troops. The report also highlights the financial aspect of the conflict, estimating Russian spending at 53 billion roubles ($1 billion). Nemtsov's work was motivated by the lack of promised compensation to families of deceased Russian soldiers. Despite the report's compelling evidence, publishing and distributing it proved challenging due to publishers' reluctance and the question of public interest in the facts. The passage concludes by noting that the opposition accuses President Putin of masterminding the war to boost his failing popularity, a claim for which the report may face similar criticism as Nemtsov's previous works.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The Welsh government aims for a balance between environmental, economic, and social factors in forestry development, as outlined in its Glastir scheme and Woodlands for Wales strategy.

This trend is part of a broader pattern of glacier retreat observed in other Alpine regions across several European nations. The research, led by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie, utilized historical maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs to assess the condition of roughly 600 glaciers in the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the Mont Blanc Massif. The study highlights that the retreat is more pronounced in the southern sectors of the Alps, with glaciers in the Belledonne and Ecrins massifs showing particularly severe reductions. Factors contributing to this disparity include lower elevations and different climatic conditions in the southern Alps, such as higher precipitation and cloud cover. The northern Alps, including the famous La Mer de Glace glacier, have experienced less dramatic retreat. The findings underscore the ongoing challenges in monitoring and assessing glacier health across the Alpine region, with similar trends reported in Switzerland.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

While the industry only contributes 0.5% to GDP and employs 12,000 people, it must not be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been criticized for disadvantaging Britain, but Brexit presents a chance for the industry to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the report warns that EU member states may demand more access to UK waters, potentially leading to four different fisheries management regimes. The industry argues that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats, with the EU recently announcing new quotas under the CFP, which are seen as favorable for the UK. The government emphasizes the importance of ensuring British companies have maximum freedom to trade in the single market while reviewing fisheries management for fair access to quota and sustainable stocks.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

After the human genome's publication, he shifted focus to creating a synthetic life form, resulting in the development of Synthia, an organism published in Science. Born in 1946, Venter initially pursued surfing in Southern California before joining the Vietnam War, which instilled a sense of urgency and a commitment to medicine. His medical training led him to the US National Institute of Health, where he recognized the potential of automated decoding machines to accelerate gene sequencing. Leaving the NIH in 1992, Venter founded The Institute for Genomic Research and later Celera Genomics in 1995, which announced the first complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae. In 1998, he formed Celera Genomics to complete the human genome in three years, a project that published its results in 2001. Despite controversy over his methods and disregard for scientific conventions, Venter's financial success allowed him to pursue his scientific goals independently. In 2006, he established the J Craig Venter Institute to create the world's first synthetic life form. Venter's work has also included oceanographic projects to sequence microbial genomes from the sea, aiming to advance understanding of gene and protein functions and potentially revolutionize industrial processes.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

In healthcare, VR is being used for teaching purposes and to treat phobias, such as helping soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder and aiding arachnophobics in overcoming their fear of spiders. Additionally, VR is being explored for educational purposes, with apps like Evanescent Studios' Mandarin language learning tool and Google's Expeditions program, which takes students on virtual field trips.

The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later in the year. While a property tax is considered a \"good tax\" by academics due to its stability and ability to impact housing markets, it generates confusion among taxpayers and is perceived as unfair by some. A local income tax, seen as fairer by many, creates difficulties for local authorities due to fluctuating income. The commission concludes that there is no \"magic bullet\" for reform, noting that past experiences show reform is difficult and tied to previous reform traumas. The Scottish government, considering the current council tax system unfair, has established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to explore fairer alternatives, with a public consultation planned before the report is published in the autumn.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, highlights that the increase in binge drinking is largely driven by women's changing social norms and increased access to alcohol, particularly among affluent individuals in urban areas. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who consume any alcohol has remained relatively stable.

This map, produced using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the 570-megapixel Dark Energy Camera, reveals clumps of dark matter across the cosmos. The map will eventually expand to cover 12.5% of the sky over five years, allowing astronomers to study the formation of galaxies and the nature of dark energy, which is believed to be causing the universe's accelerated expansion. Dark matter, which makes up at least 80% of the matter in the universe, cannot be directly observed but can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-micro","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":-1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}
