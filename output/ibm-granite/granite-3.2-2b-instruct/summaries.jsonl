The research, conducted by Finnish scientists, analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, comparing their weight and height with their antibiotic prescription records. The findings indicate that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Notably, children who were prescribed antibiotics during their early infancy, especially if the treatment was repeated, showed a higher likelihood of being overweight. Boys appeared to be more susceptible to weight gain post-antibiotic treatment, and they also tended to be slightly taller.\n\nWhile the study did not definitively prove that antibiotics cause weight gain, it suggests a potential mechanism: antibiotics might eliminate beneficial gut bacteria that normally aid in digestion, leaving more food available for the body and potentially increasing appetite. This could contribute to the obesity epidemic, which is already concerning, with one in five boys and one in ten girls in England being overweight or obese by age 10-11.\n\nDr. Antti Saari, the lead author, emphasized the need for cautious antibiotic use in infancy, warning that excessive exposure could exacerbate the global childhood obesity issue. He also highlighted the broader concern about antibiotics losing their effectiveness due to overuse, which could lead to more severe infections. The study underscores the importance of balancing the benefits of antibiotics with the potential risks, particularly in early childhood.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This proposal, outlined in the \"Ending Expensive Social Tenancies\" report, aims to stimulate the largest social house building program since the 1970s. Neil O'Brien, Policy Exchange's director, asserts that this strategy would reduce the number of people waiting for social housing by approximately 500,000. \n\nHowever, Labour opposes this plan, arguing that it would exacerbate the housing crisis by driving low-income families out of desirable neighborhoods. Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey contends that the government should instead use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and employ unemployed builders to boost the construction industry.\n\nPolicy Exchange identifies expensive social housing (worth more than the average property in each region) as 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, totaling 816,000 properties. Selling these could potentially raise up to \u00a3159bn. London alone holds over \u00a370bn of such properties. The think tank suggests that about 3.5% of social housing becomes vacant annually, enabling the sale of 28,500 properties yearly, generating \u00a35.5bn.

The atmosphere was lively, with smoke-filled newsrooms and typewriters being the norm.\n\nHowever, the era of Fleet Street's dominance began to wane in the late 1980s when media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, sparking a dispute with unions. This led to most national newspapers relocating to other parts of London, adopting computerized printing technology. Consequently, the iconic Fleet Street buildings transformed into various commercial uses.\n\nSmith, now a freelance journalist, and Sherriff, taking time to write his memoirs, reflect on their experiences. Despite the closure of their London office, they express a sense of pride and nostalgia for being part of this historic journalistic landscape. Their departure marks the end of an era, with the buildings now housing supermarkets, restaurants, and other businesses, yet the legacy of Fleet Street remains a significant part of British media history.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This study, which has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, also highlights that poverty significantly heightens the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. Poorer youth are approximately five times more likely to be under statutory supervision than their better-off peers, even when other risk factors are considered.\n\nThe research underscores that household poverty acts as an amplifier for offending behavior, with individuals in extreme poverty being more prone to both victimization and perpetration of crimes. Gender plays a significant role too, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds twice as likely to be involved in violent crime, even after accounting for factors like truancy, substance abuse, and inadequate parental supervision.\n\nThe study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government, was published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal. Professor Lesley McAra, the report's author, emphasized that the interaction between poverty and the juvenile justice system inadvertently perpetuates conditions conducive to violence.\n\nDespite a recent decline in overall crime rates in Scotland, the study by the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh's Law School indicates that the most crime-ridden communities remain disproportionately poor, with high levels of chronic health problems and unemployment. This suggests that crime remains concentrated amongst the poorest and most vulnerable, a trend that persists even as overall crime rates decrease.\n\nThe Scottish government, acknowledging the 41-year low in recorded crime, homicide rates at their lowest in 39 years, and increased police presence, maintains that it is actively addressing poverty and inequalities through initiatives like a \u00a3296 million investment to mitigate the impacts of UK welfare cuts.

This study debunks the \"reticent female\" theory, which suggests women avoid asking for pay rises due to fear of upsetting their bosses or adhering to stereotypes. The research found no evidence supporting this notion. Instead, it revealed that men are 25% more likely to receive a pay rise when they ask for one, compared to women. When comparing full-time male and female workers, and part-time male and female workers, the study controlled for factors like employer size, industry, parental status, and qualifications. The findings suggest that women and men under 40 ask for and receive pay rises equally, indicating a potential shift in negotiating behavior among younger women. Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick, a co-author, noted that the results imply a degree of discrimination against women in the workplace, possibly due to men's reluctance to publicly share unsuccessful pay rise requests.

It argues that President Vladimir Putin is waging war in Ukraine for personal gain, citing decisive Russian military involvement in key rebel victories in Donetsk and Luhansk. Despite Russia's denial of sending regular troops, the report presents evidence of Russian soldiers and equipment being crucial to rebel successes, with volunteers admitting to being directed by Russian generals. The spending on the conflict is estimated at 53 billion roubles (approximately \u00a3665 million). The opposition plans to distribute 2,000 copies initially, seeking further donations for wider dissemination, acknowledging the challenge in publishing such a controversial document due to fears from publishers and the potential lack of public interest in confronting the government's actions.

This contrasts with the party's previous stance against such policies. The country's tourism sector, particularly Athens airport, is experiencing a significant surge with 25 million expected arrivals this year, up from 21 million, indicating a growing interest in Greece as a holiday destination.\n\nThe reasons behind this apparent acceptance of austerity measures are multifaceted. One theory suggests that Greeks might be anticipating the potential euro break-up, hoping to witness history. Another possibility is that Greece's appeal as a safer holiday destination compared to areas under Islamic State control is a major draw.\n\nThe lack of public resistance could be attributed to the impending revelation of the extent of concessions made by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to secure an additional \u20ac86 billion in credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF. This third bailout aims to stabilize Greece's economy, which has been crippled by debt.\n\nTsipras' decision to agree to these terms, despite his party's election campaign against them, is often attributed to Greece's near-bankruptcy in July, which transformed Syriza into advocates of the \"there is no alternative\" (TINA) approach. Despite this, Tsipras remains popular, possibly due to the economic uncertainty and the need for stability.\n\nHowever, Greece is grappling with a severe economic squeeze, exacerbated by the continued partial bank closure, which limits lending capacity. This situation poses a significant risk to businesses, with many unable to secure foreign credit for investments, potentially leading to a cancelled Christmas season.\n\nThe success of this new bailout hinges on Tsipras' ability to instill hope for future prosperity.

By the late 2000s, this area had diminished to around 275 sq km, indicating a significant retreat. This study, presented at the AGU Fall Meeting, is based on research conducted by Marie Gardent from the University of Savoie and her team. They analyzed roughly 600 glaciers across major French Alps massifs like Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye, Grande Rousse Arves, and Mont Blanc. Their inventory, the first in four decades, utilized map archives, past satellite imagery, and aerial photographs, with manual inspections to validate satellite data, addressing issues like debris cover and shadows affecting glacier detection.\n\nThe initial French Alps glacier inventory, published in the 1980s, noted an overall area of about 375 sq km, which had decreased to nearly 340 sq km by 1985-86. The new survey reveals an average annual loss of approximately 26% over the past 40 years, with the retreat accelerating since the late 1980s. The southern sectors of the French Alps have experienced the most substantial glacial retreat, with the Belledonne Massif seeing almost complete glacier disappearance and the Ecrins Massif showing retreat more than three times faster than the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\nThe northern Alps, with their higher mountain elevations and different climatic conditions, have seen less dramatic glacier retreat. The largest French glacier, La Mer de Glace, which descends Mont Blanc, has reduced to about 30 sq km, slightly less than its 1960s/1970s size of 31.5 sq km. This study underscores ongoing efforts to monitor and assess glacier health across the Alpine region, with similar findings reported by Swiss researchers about glacier mass loss in their part of the European Alps.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Post-human genome publication, Venter focused on creating synthetic life forms, culminating in the creation of Synthia, a synthetic organism, published in Science in 2010.\n\nBorn in 1946, Venter's life took a dramatic turn during his service in Vietnam, where he worked as a naval hospital orderly, witnessing the high cost of life. This experience instilled in him a strong sense of urgency and a commitment to efficiency. He pursued medical training, excelling in research rather than practice.\n\nIn the 1980s, Venter was instrumental in the early molecular biology revolution, recognizing the importance of gene decoding. He introduced automated decoding machines to his lab, speeding up the process. His breakthrough came when he shifted focus from the DNA blueprint to RNA, the messenger molecules cells use naturally, enabling rapid generation of gene sequences.\n\nVenter's work, though initially met with skepticism from notable scientists like James Watson, led to his departure from the National Institutes of Health in 1992. He founded The Institute for Genomic Research and, in 1995, became the first to sequence the genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nIn 1998, Venter founded Celera Genomics, aiming to decode the human genome in three years, challenging the public project's 10-year timeline. Both efforts published their results in 2001. Venter's approach, which prioritized commercialization and speed over open data access, was met with controversy and criticism.\n\nDespite this, Venter's financial success from Celera Genomics provided him with substantial resources to establish the J Craig Venter Institute in 2006. This institute led the creation of the world's first synthetic life form, Synthia, through an extensive genetic exploration of marine microbes.\n\nVenter's synthetic life project, while controversial, holds potential for environmental benefits, such as aiding in carbon capture and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. He continues to engage with both scientific and public discourse, leveraging his resources to pursue ambitious projects beyond the traditional scientific realm.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The study indicates that fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 annual apprenticeships in England are rated at level three (equivalent to A-levels), while Germany, recognized for its robust vocational education system, offers this level to over half of its apprenticeships. The report also reveals that only 61,000 new apprenticeships in England are for young people, contrasting with Germany's 570,000, 90% of which are at A-level equivalence.\n\nThe Sutton Trust calls for a substantial expansion of apprenticeships, proposing up to 300,000 new starts annually, with a focus on level three apprenticeships lasting at least three years and some four-year level four courses. It suggests limiting two-year level two courses to no more than 10% of apprenticeships. The report emphasizes the need for a clear, respected vocational route, contrasting England's current patchwork system with Germany's, where 11 young people compete for each apprenticeship.\n\nHowever, the Association of Colleges warns that creating 300,000 new apprenticeships could be challenging, especially given the existing shortage of places for 16-year-olds. They also advocate for preserving some level two apprenticeships, like those in construction, which are valued by industry.

In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% engaged in binge drinking. The county with the lowest binge drinking rate was Madison County, Idaho (6%), while Menominee, Wisconsin, had the highest (36%).\n\nExperts attribute this surge to several factors: changing social norms making women's drinking more similar to men's, increased binge drinking among young people, and affluent individuals' ability to afford more alcohol due to economic prosperity. The influx of wealthy tech professionals in cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, with their hard-partying lifestyles, is also cited as a contributing factor.\n\nAdditionally, factors like cheaper alcohol due to stagnant taxes, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies, such as looser sales restrictions and longer bar hours, are seen as contributing to the rise in excessive drinking.

The survey by vehicle leasing firm OSV, involving 1,100 adults, also found that 5% of respondents have employed their children for car washing as a pocket money activity. Despite this, cars are more frequently washed during holidays, with Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield residents washing their cars most often, while Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh residents are least likely. Luxury brands like Audi, Toyota, and BMW are more likely to be personally washed, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are least frequently cleaned by their owners. The decline in personal car washing is seen as a result of time constraints, larger vehicle sizes, and the availability of affordable automated car wash services.", "company": "ibm-granite", "model_name": "granite-3.2-2b-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This surge is primarily due to intravenous drug users, with a significant involvement of the high-powered painkiller Opana. Typically, Scott County sees around five HIV cases annually.\n\nThe program, which has provided 5,322 clean syringes to 86 participants and collected 1,400 used syringes, has gained traction, especially with a mobile unit visiting neighborhoods to enroll more intravenous drug users. However, the future of this program and potential state-wide needle exchange legislation remain uncertain. Governor Pence, who opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy, is reviewing the situation and is expected to decide on extending the program beyond April 25.\n\nThe CDC reports that 50% to 90% of people with hepatitis C are also HIV-positive, making high hepatitis C rates a strong indicator of needle-sharing and potential HIV outbreaks. Despite the House's approval of a bill (sponsored by Chairman Ed Clere) to allow 23 counties with high hepatitis C rates to establish their own needle-exchange programs, the Senate's stance is unclear. Senate President Pro Tem David Long acknowledges concerns about needle exchanges potentially promoting drug use but suggests a need to adapt to current realities.\n\nThe sustainability of such programs is questioned due to federal funding restrictions, which have barred public funding for needle exchange since 1989.

Despite receiving death threats, she continued to host discussions, including one on Balochistan, which was shut down by university authorities due to security concerns. Her killing, along with her mother, has sparked widespread grief and outrage across Pakistan, with many mourning her as a symbol of humanism, love, and tolerance. Mahmud's brave stance in promoting open dialogue, especially on topics deemed dangerous by authorities, made her a figurehead for those yearning for freedom of expression.

The assault, dubbed by Philadelphia authorities as the 'Tattoo Terrorists' operation, took place in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, northeast Philadelphia, from late March to early April 2014.\n\nCampbell, believing Vallecce had harmed his cat and stolen money and marijuana, orchestrated the attack along with Ng and Halin. They brutally beat, spat on, and tattooed Vallecce, who was tied to a chair for three days. The tattoos included 'Rip Pebbles', a smiley face with breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose, and offensive phrases like 'gay pride' and swastikas. Vallecce sustained severe injuries, including three broken ribs, two broken wrists, and facial fractures.\n\nThe trio filmed the abuse, with the video played in court. Vallecce managed to escape after 42 hours, contacting police. During a search of the house, authorities found a tattoo gun, needles, ink, and related paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana and prescription drugs. Vallecce has since had the tattoos removed at no cost, but the trauma has left him with lasting psychological distress.\n\nCampbell was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, Ng to 23 months, and Halin the same term. Another defendant, David Thomas, 28, is awaiting sentencing, while Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial. The group was charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy, and false imprisonment, all of which they pleaded guilty to.

His research, detailed in the book \"Sex by Numbers,\" indicates that the typical heterosexual couple is now having sex three times a month, a significant drop from four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the blurring of boundaries between public and private lives, with constant smartphone use and email checking eroding \"quiet empty time\" that was previously available for intimacy.
