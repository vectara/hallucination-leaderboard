The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March. FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto. Muto tussles with Yuji Nakawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month. Age: 22 Club: FC Tokyo Appearances: 37 Goals: 16 International caps (Japan): 11 International goals: 1 Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago. Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club. Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season. The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year. He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season. The initial five-year deal is the biggest in the club's history, with the Blues now considering a two-week pre-season tour of Japan this summer.\n\n### Answer\nChelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane.

New Zealander Tim Weston, who was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta, witnessed the event and explained that there is a crocodile sanctuary nearby where the creatures are protected. Crocodiles are a common sight in Puerto Vallarta due to the mangroves they have inhabited for centuries, and they are often spotted on the resort's golf course.

Despite the exam session finishing, Guffick asked pupils to make changes to their answers and also altered some of the answers himself before the papers were sent off. The local education authority investigated the suspected breach of exam rules, leading to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school. Guffick admitted the allegations and accepted that his conduct amounted to unacceptable professional behavior. Although he claimed he only asked the pupils to make their answers more legible, the conduct panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, ruled that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. The panel chair, Martin Pilkington, stated that while Guffick's conduct was dishonest, it did not reach the level of fraud or serious dishonesty. However, he emphasized that Guffick's behavior was unacceptable and that he deeply regrets his actions. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years, agreeing with the panel's recommendation that a prohibition order was an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool’s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter. He said: ‘It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. It’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension. ‘When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,’ said Rodgers. ‘Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals. It’s all part of the journey — losing but taking that forward and improving you.’ Rodgers (left) hasn't revealed whether he'll recall Gerrard for Sunday's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

They warn that failing to support Dyke's proposals could make it harder for England to win the World Cup and fall further behind other leading football nations.

The British Geological Survey (BGS) is examining data collected to determine if the drilling is responsible for the earthquake. A similar earthquake occurred on April 1st, centered near Poulton-le-Fylde. Shale gas drilling involves fracturing hard shale rocks to release gas using hydraulic pressure or explosions. Cuadrilla's CEO, Mark Miller, stated that the company will consult with authorities and experts before deciding on resuming operations, which may take several weeks. Environmentalists have raised concerns about potential contamination of drinking water from shale gas leaks, but the Commons energy select committee supports the process in the UK, arguing that environmental issues in the US can be addressed through regulation and good industry practice. The BGS is also monitoring fracking as a precautionary measure. Two small earthquakes have occurred in Lancashire since fracking began in March, including the latest one on Friday. The BGS analyzed the April earthquake and determined that it occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles) near the Preese Hall site, with data from nearby instruments suggesting a similar location and mechanism to the earlier event.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The bills were introduced in response to the situation in Ukraine, where separatist and pro-Russian sentiments are strong in Crimea. The first bill aims to streamline the process for a neighboring state to become a part of Russia, even in the absence of a treaty, if the territory's leaders express a clear will and desire for annexation. The second bill seeks to expedite the process of issuing Russian passports to Ukrainians, particularly those of Russian descent, without requiring them to meet the usual criteria such as sufficient funds or renouncing their Ukrainian citizenship. These proposals are seen as a response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Russia's historical actions in supporting separatist movements in Georgia's regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

For decades, Fleet Street housed the offices of many of the nation's biggest newspapers, including the Sunday Post, which is mentioned in the passage. The street was known for its many bars and pubs where journalists socialized and sought stories. However, with the advent of television and social media, the importance of newspapers declined, leading to the departure of most national newspapers from Fleet Street. The closure of the Sunday Post's London office marked the end of an era, as Fleet Street had been the pinnacle of a journalist's career for many years. Despite the closure, some journalists, like Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith, are continuing their careers in journalism, albeit in different capacities. The passage also mentions Robin Esser, a former Sunday Express editor, who described Fleet Street as a very important place in the early days of journalism when most information came through newspapers. Liz Hodgkinson, a former journalist who worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 1980s, recalled the heavy alcohol consumption among journalists and the social dynamics of the industry.

Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, and is an exacerbating factor that increases the likelihood of young people offending. The study also found that people who live in extreme poverty are more likely to be both victims and perpetrators of crime. Additionally, gender is a powerful predictor of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime. The findings highlight a destructive dynamic where poverty increases the risks of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. Despite the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland, areas with the most chronic rates of crime have not benefitted, and victims experiencing the most crime continue to be within the most deprived communities. The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society and is tackling poverty and inequalities through various initiatives.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The violence has primarily targeted civilians along ethnic lines, with Dinka and Nuer tribes being the main groups involved.

The APC leader, Muhammadu Buhari, will be inaugurated on 29 May after defeating President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP lost control of key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, as well as Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The APC made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could be a concern for President-elect Muhammadu Buhari due to potential disruptions in oil production and revenue. The elections were marred by violence in some areas, but overall, they were more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. The PDP will have to go through a period of introspection and rebuild itself under a new leader, as it had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections and faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

This initiative is inspired by a visit to Denmark to study their diagnostic systems. The concern is that patients in Wales who do not show clear symptoms may have to wait a long time for diagnosis, as they don't easily fit into any specialized treatment pathways. This often leads to doctors referring patients back and forth for numerous tests over several weeks. Consequently, there's a fear that some patients may start treatment when their cancer has progressed or when it's unlikely to be curable. The program aims to have 40 doctors in Cwm Cynon believe there might be something they can do to quickly refer patients to the diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant within seven days. Ideally, one-sixth of patients would be seen and tested within a month, hoping for early diagnosis. Currently, only 35% of patients with non-obvious cancer symptoms receive a diagnosis in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors hope to reach the majority of patients with obvious cancer symptoms sooner. A similar clinic is planned at Castell-Nedd Port Talbot as part of another trial by the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board. Trials have been developed over the past 12 months since experts from Wales returned from Aarhus. Denmark established their diagnostic centers after concerns about the country's cancer incidence rates. According to Dr. Gareth Davies, the head of the Cancer Research Wales Network, the plan will reassure patients but also speed up the process. \"If a family doctor sees a patient who is not sure what's causing their symptoms but is worried and feels there might be something, they will give the patient the opportunity to be quickly referred to the clinic and hopefully diagnosed,\" he says. Gareth Jordan, a family doctor in Aberdare, believes the pilot plan could make a significant difference in patients' lives. \"It would be possible to say, 'I've seen the man here, he's lost a lot of weight... he might not be sent off for specialist tests or he might not be tested in the usual order,' but the fact that they are being seen in one place and everyone is seeing an improvement, the likelihood is early diagnosis if they do have cancer,\" he says. If the Cwm Cynon pilot - which will run for six months - is successful, the rest of the health boards in the area will offer the same service in the coming months.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

It highlights that the UK fishing industry only produces a small portion of the country's GDP and employs a limited number of people, but it still must not be marginalized in the wider Brexit negotiations. The European Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has often been criticized by the industry as a disaster for Britain, but Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and potentially become a leading fish-exporting nation. However, the report also points out that many commercial fish stocks are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states, and continued market access for UK fish exports may come at a price, with EU member states potentially demanding more access to UK waters. The report suggests that the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas continue to be based on scientific advice and that the UK should maintain international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states.

According to Snowden's leaks, the NSA has access to a vast amount of individual data, including chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers, and social networking data. The US government confirmed it requested millions of phone records from Verizon, including call duration, location, and phone numbers. The documents also revealed that the NSA has \"backdoor\" access to servers of major technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple, which process and store vast amounts of information. These companies have denied their involvement, and the exact workings of Prism, the surveillance program, are unclear. The NSA Director, Keith Alexander, defended the eavesdropping operations, stating they have helped keep Americans secure. However, some experts question the true powers of Prism. The passage also touches on data protection laws, which vary by country and aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers and how they can use it. The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in the US. The passage concludes by discussing the implications of Prism for internet users, with privacy concerns being raised by groups like Privacy International. Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, expressed concerns about privacy and the potential for widespread surveillance.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier.

Worries about the economic impact of leaving the EU were also blamed for a big fall in Asian stock markets, with Japan's Nikkei index closing 3.5% down and Hong Kong's main index sliding 2.5%.

{"article_id":583,"summary_uid":"93014ba881e33a921e14240ecefffdac","summary":"The passage discusses a study commissioned by Tablets for Schools, which found that while many pupils use tablet devices in schools, there is no clear evidence of academic improvement. The study looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools, with 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools using tablets to some extent. However, some schools had a more intensive use, with 9% having an individual tablet device for every pupil. The study suggests that the use of tablet computers in schools is increasing, with 45% of schools not currently using them expecting to introduce them soon. Despite the growing use of tablets in schools, researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. However, head teachers reported a positive impact, and tablets help motivate disengaged pupils and increase family involvement when pupils take them home. The study also highlights the increasing presence of online technology in young people's lives, with a quarter of secondary pupils describing themselves as internet \"addicts\" and two-thirds taking a computer device or smartphone to bed with them.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

His wife, Ganna Ziuzina, who was 19 years younger than him, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, stating that Barry's guard was lowered by inebriation and that the car had stolen license plates and did not brake or stop. The case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a death abroad, and Ms Ziuzina was known to have tried to claim her husband's assets within days of his death. Close friend Peter Clifford had \"no reasonable doubt\" that Barry was murdered. Ms Ziuzina, who claimed to be a teacher when the couple first met, was actually a lap dancer and stripper. She sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat, and moved funds from his bank account. The inquest heard that she was entitled to the first £200,000 of his estate and that computer records revealed she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man. Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said \"strenuous attempts\" had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success. In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made \"three separate statements to Ukrainian police\" and did not believe she could \"add anything further\". Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph. He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing \"as a deliberate act\". The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry.

It highlights that fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favor of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has often been criticized by the industry as detrimental to Britain. However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that examines the risks and opportunities for the UK fishing industry. The report suggests that while the industry might be a low priority for the government, it must not be marginalized in the wider Brexit negotiations. The UK fishing industry only produces a small fraction of the country's GDP and employs a limited number of fishers. The most commercial fish stocks are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states, and a successful industry requires continued market access. Brexit may involve trade-offs, and EU member states may demand more access to UK waters in return for continued rights to sell fish to the European market. The report also points out that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit, and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas are based on scientific advice. The UK will continue to be under international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states. The passage also mentions that the EU recently announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP, which many analysts say marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock, and prawns. Representatives from the industry expressed optimism about the future of British fishing outside the EU, believing that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South. Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them. I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking. It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves. You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing. The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted. The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane. 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts 22 May - Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary. When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000. They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street. But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option. Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover. The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates. The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out.\"Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi- final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go.And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride.Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman\"I Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there.\"We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.\"But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there.\"More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that.\"Six-time Olympic gold medallist Chris Hoy\"I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in.\"But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race.\"He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team.\"Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson.The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress.She told the BBC: \"It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting.\"The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in.\"Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds.\"Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: \"Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal.\"Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them.\"Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round.The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong.The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday.Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin.\"I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected,\" she said.\"I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great.\"I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo.\"Media playback is not supported on this device\nI am unable to summarize this text.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The PDP lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, and also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the PDP managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The APC made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states, which could be a concern for President-elect Muhammadu Buhari due to the potential disruption of oil production and revenue. The elections were marred by violence in some areas, but overall, they were more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. The PDP will have to go through a period of introspection and rebuild itself under a new leader.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The council tax has inherent problems from its inception, and failing to modify it has led to more difficulties for policymakers. The commission, established by the Scottish government and Cosla, will report later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, reviewed various local taxation systems worldwide and found that property taxes are widely used and considered stable and difficult to avoid. However, they can cause confusion as taxpayers are unclear whether it's a tax on wealth or a charge for services. Some find it unfair because it's not linked to current income. Local income taxes, used by many countries, are perceived as fairer but create difficulties for local authorities due to fluctuating income and limited opportunities to vary tax rates based on local priorities. The commission plans to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. The Scottish government considers the current council tax system unfair and has established the commission to examine fairer alternatives.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

A study of 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations found that those who underwent an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) after diagnosis had a significantly lower risk of dying from breast cancer—62% lower compared to those who did not have the surgery. This protective effect was especially pronounced in women with the BRCA1 mutation, with a 73% reduction in death within two years of diagnosis. The study, published in *JAMA Oncology*, suggests that oophorectomy could become part of treatment discussions for early-stage BRCA1 carriers, particularly those with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer.

The study, conducted by Courtney Blackwell at Northwestern University, involved 352 students in a midwestern suburban school district over an academic year. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher in tests than those using devices individually or not at all. Blackwell suggests that the collaborative learning around the technology, rather than collaboration alone, contributes to the improved literacy outcomes. The findings may prompt schools to reconsider how they use tablets, particularly in earlier grades, to maximize their effectiveness.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

This algae blooms in the spring and autumn, and in 90% of cases, it occurs naturally. An oceanography expert from the University of New South Wales, Iain Suthers, explained that the algae gives off a luminous glow as a defense mechanism, preying on another type of algae called diatoms.

After surgery, cancer cells are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as 5%, which is as good as or better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women with breast cancer are currently given chemotherapy following tumor removal to prevent recurrence, but the side effects can be difficult to live with. Experts believe that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is lower than for others, and for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest test, called Endopredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of these tests are currently only available privately, but breast specialists hope they may soon become available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal and Professor Kefah Mokbel support the use of this test, stating that it can help patients make informed choices and potentially save costs by avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

At least 25 women have been airlifted from these ships, with one ship, HMS Ocean, having five pregnant sailors removed in emergency \"medevacs\" over nine years. At least one woman was airlifted from HMS Illustrious, which was nicknamed \"HMS Lusty\" by the crew before it was decommissioned. Eighteen other ships had emergency evacuations due to pregnancy. The Ministry of Defence confirmed a strict \"no touching\" rule at sea, suggesting the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave. The passage also mentions that women have been serving on Royal Navy ships since 1990, with around 9% of personnel being female in 2014. In 2015, three women became the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Nearly 100 female British soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant between 2006 and 2013. Sixteen women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy, and 18 were sent home in 2011. A further 102 women were evacuated from Iraq. Strict military rules ban mothers-to-be from serving in war zones, and troops are reminded to check they are not pregnant before flying to the front line.

The study found that heavy drinking among Americans rose by 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012, largely due to rising rates among women. Heavy drinking is defined as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Binge drinking, defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month, also increased. The study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, revealing significant variations in binge drinking rates across different regions. Factors contributing to the increase in excessive drinking include changing social norms, increased acceptance of women drinking like men, young people's tendency to binge drink, affluence allowing for more spending on alcohol, cheaper alcohol prices due to lack of tax increases, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study highlights the growing concern over excessive drinking and its associated health risks and costs.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean rates should ideally be between 10% and 15%, but in England, over a quarter of births are caesarean, a rate that has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This trend is partly due to women opting for planned caesareans out of anxiety about natural birth. Experts from the WHO state that while caesareans can save lives, they are often performed without medical necessity, leading to complications and diverting resources from other patients. The NHS cost for a planned caesarean is higher than for a natural birth, and previous research indicates that up to one in ten caesareans result in infections.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

At this price, the annual rent would be around £15,000, comparable to the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area. However, if a buyer extends the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million. The flat, described as bright and well-proportioned with 1,990 sq/ft of space, includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, and a utility room, along with amenities like a lift, parking, and a communal garden. The property is one of two maisonettes being sold with similar terms; the larger one is priced at £595,000. The current freeholder is the Welcome Trust, and any buyer would need to negotiate a lease extension, which could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million for a 90-year lease. The area, known for its high property values, has seen interest from locals, developers, and end users, with estimates suggesting modernized conditions could fetch between £2.75 and £3.00 per sq/ft. Estate agents warn that while the property appears cheap, extending the lease will incur a significant premium. The properties were originally built in 1893 by John Grover and Son for architect Mervyn Macartney, featuring high-quality architecture and four main storeys with basements and garrets.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

A study by vehicle leasing firm OSV found that one-third of men have never washed their own car, with only 12% doing it regularly. Factors contributing to this decline include more people having Sundays off due to shops opening on Sundays and increased availability of live football on TV, leading to more people putting off the chore on weekends. The rise of hand car washes and the size of modern vehicles, such as 4x4s and off-road cars, are also blamed for the decrease in car washing by owners. However, people are more likely to wash their cars during holidays, with an estimated 15 million cars cleaned during the recent Easter break. Cars are most likely to be washed by their owners in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least likely in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas, and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners, while Range Rovers, Peugeots, and Mercedes are least often.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

This map, created using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) conducted with the 13-foot Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, shows clumps of dark matter in red and less dark matter in blue. The goal is to eventually map 12.5 percent of the sky over five years to create a 3D view of dark matter and dark energy. The map helps astronomers study galaxy formation and the nature of dark energy, which is believed to accelerate the universe's expansion. The DES, led by Fermilab, uses the Blanco telescope and its Dark Energy Camera to capture detailed images of galaxies, analyzing over 130 million separate telescope images to construct the map. This research supports current cosmological theories that galaxies form in regions with large concentrations of dark matter.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Research indicates that the number of times a typical heterosexual couple has sex per month has decreased from five times in 1990 to three times in 2015. Factors contributing to this decline include the blurring of boundaries between public and private lives, increased email checking, and a general increase in busier lifestyles with less time dedicated to personal relationships.

He is determined not to rush himself back to action ahead of time and will be cautious, taking stage-by-stage assessments to determine his readiness. Brown was knocked out cold in England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham in February and pulled out of the Ireland game due to symptoms. He emphasizes the importance of learning about the symptoms of concussion through online modules, which helped him realize he would not be ready to face Ireland. Brown urges teammates not to play on if they are showing symptoms, as pushing through can be dangerous in the long and short term.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

According to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, the average heterosexual couple now has sex about three times a month, down from four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990. This trend is linked to the integration of public and private lives, with people constantly checking emails and other digital devices, which reduces the quiet, undisturbed time couples need for intimacy. Additionally, the increasing number of competing demands on people's time, including work-related emails late in the evening, means that sexual activity is often deprioritized.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

Once highly sought after and commanding prices up to £1.2 million each, these dogs are now being sent to slaughterhouses and their meat used in cheap hotpots due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown and bans on owning large dogs in several cities. The breed's quality has deteriorated due to cross-breeding for profit, leading to a glut of poor-quality dogs that can't be sold. Urbanization has also made the breed less suitable for city living, contributing to their decline.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}

The top ten emergencies identified in a survey of 2,000 people included not being able to sleep, losing keys, being stuck in traffic when already late, losing important documents, not being able to park, printer issues, running out of phone battery, discovering lack of toilet paper, dealing with machine-operated customer service, forgetting a bank card, and more. Three prototypes were shortlisted: Forget Me Lock by Onn Studio, which reassures users if their door is locked; Nipper, the world's smallest mobile phone charger by Impulse; and Snooze, an alarm clock by Instruments that silences phone notifications for better sleep. The winner of the competition will be determined through a Kickstarter campaign and retweets using the hashtag #EverydayFix.","company":"ibm-granite","model_name":"granite-4.0-h-tiny","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-10-04","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat"}
