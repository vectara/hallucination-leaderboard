NHS Improvement, the regulator, aims to decrease this by \u00a31bn by the end of the current financial year. A cap on agency staff costs was introduced in October, saving \u00a3600m so far. The cap limits hospitals, mental health trusts, and ambulance services to paying no more than 55% above normal shift rates for agency staff, excluding senior managers. The goal is to lower the overall cost of agency staff and reduce hospitals' reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive due to additional fees and employer costs. While progress is promising, the NHS is still short of its target, with trusts 10% below their desired agency spending. The agency bill is decreasing, but it's unclear if spending on other pay elements has increased. NHS Improvement will publish league tables of trusts' agency spending and collect data on the highest-earning agency staff per trust.
