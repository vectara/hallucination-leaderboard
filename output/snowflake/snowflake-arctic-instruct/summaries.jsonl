The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds with records on antibiotic prescription and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese by two years old. Children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, and repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the obesity epidemic by killing off gut bacteria that would normally feed on some of the food eaten, thus freeing up more food for the body and potentially increasing appetite.", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The geoglyphs are possibly 2,000 years old and were concealed for centuries by bamboo-dominated rainforest until modern deforestation revealed them. The purpose of these sites is still unknown, but they are unlikely to be villages as few artifacts have been found during excavation. Researchers believe they may have been used sporadically as ritual gathering places. Dr. Neil Loader analyzed soil samples to reconstruct ancient vegetation and found that the geoglyphs were likely constructed amongst taller vegetation, not visible above the forest canopy. This challenges previous assumptions that the Amazonian forests were pristine ecosystems before the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th century. Instead, it appears humans transformed their environment by focusing on economically valuable trees such as palms, creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful", "company": "snowflake", "model_name": "snowflake-arctic-instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
