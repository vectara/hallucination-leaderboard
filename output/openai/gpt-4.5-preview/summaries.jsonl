These earthworks, known as geoglyphs, were hidden beneath bamboo-dominated rainforest until recent deforestation revealed over 450 large geometric structures.

Unlike other ritual sites such as Maya pyramids or Stonehenge, these geoglyphs were constructed within taller vegetation and were probably not visible above the forest canopy. Analysis of soil samples, phytoliths, charcoal, and carbon isotopes indicates that humans significantly influenced the Amazonian environment, selectively cultivating economically valuable trees rather than extensively burning forests.

Public fatigue from past military interventions and political reticence have contributed to this neglect. Despite growing global instability, the UK has significantly reduced its military capabilities, including cuts to army personnel, naval ships, and air force squadrons, creating capability gaps such as the absence of Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Defence spending has fallen from fourth to sixth globally, and the UK is projected to soon drop below NATO's symbolic 2% GDP spending target. Major parties have avoided detailed defence commitments, with only smaller parties explicitly supporting the 2% target. Further defence budget cuts appear likely, given fiscal pressures and lack of political protection for defence spending. The Conservatives have limited their options by promising to maintain army size, increase equipment budgets, and renew the Trident nuclear deterrent, while Labour and Liberal Democrats propose more cautious approaches to nuclear deterrence. The upcoming Strategic Defence Review may reconsider nuclear spending, especially given US concerns about the UK's declining conventional capabilities. Additionally, the UK's new aircraft carriers face staffing and equipment shortages, raising concerns about a \"hollow force\" unable to match political rhetoric of global military influence.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": "2025-02-27", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A Canadian study of 676 breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations found that ovary removal after diagnosis reduced breast cancer death by 62% in BRCA1 carriers, but not in BRCA2 carriers. Overall, ovary removal was associated with a 65% reduction in death from all causes. The protective effect was strongest when surgery occurred within two years of diagnosis, showing a 73% reduction in death. Researchers suggest ovary removal should be considered as part of initial treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers, especially those with early-stage breast cancer. BRCA mutations significantly increase lifetime breast cancer risk (50-80%), and are more common among Ashkenazi Jewish women. Jolie, who underwent both a double mastectomy and ovary removal, publicly supported the procedure, emphasizing it did not diminish her sense of femininity.", "company": "openai", "model_name": "gpt-4.5-preview", "date_code": "2025-02-27", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
