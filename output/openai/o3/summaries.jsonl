Overall, 20 % of boys and 10 % of girls were overweight/obese, with boys showing the strongest link to early antibiotic use (they were also slightly taller). While the research does not prove causation, the authors suggest antibiotics may promote weight gain by disrupting gut bacteria that normally limit calorie absorption or appetite, paralleling their fattening effect in farm animals. The findings highlight concerns that widespread, early-life antibiotic prescribing could be contributing to the global childhood-obesity epidemic and reinforce calls for more judicious use of these drugs."}

England U17 midfielder Callum Gribbin settled the game just before the hour, winning and curling in a free-kick past City keeper Charlie Albinson. United, set up by coach Paul McGuinness with three centre-backs and wing-backs, also went close through Marcus Rashford and a Cameron Borthwick-Jackson drive that hit the bar. City’s best chances fell to Marcus Wood, substitute Aaron Nemane and a late Javairo Dilrosun free-kick onto the roof of the net. Thirteen of the 22 starters were English—10 from Greater Manchester—and roughly 1,000 watched free of charge. The victory leaves United two points behind Middlesbrough with a game in hand in the Barclays U18 Premier League play-off series, while injury-hit City have lost both of their play-off fixtures. The match underlined the depth of local talent pushing for future senior opportunities."}

They scored 59 first-half goals in 2013-14 but only four so far this season.  \n• Midfield runners are absent, set-piece output has collapsed, and the defence remains fragile despite heavy spending (e.g. Lovren £20 m, Sakho £18 m). There is still no organiser at the back and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet does not command his area.  \n\nSavage’s team v Chelsea  \nMignolet; Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno; Can, Gerrard; Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana; Borini.  \nHe would drop Lovren, retain Toure after his Madrid display, and pick Borini for energy up front, using alternating full-back raids while always leaving five players behind the ball.  \n\nOutlook for the Chelsea match  \nChelsea “are on a different planet” and, as in April, Savage expects them to leave Anfield with three points.  \n\nSteven Gerrard’s situation  \nThe captain still looked Liverpool’s best player at Newcastle and can extend his career in a deep-midfield role, but at 34 must win the physical and mental battle to prove “his legs haven’t gone.” Despite last season’s costly slip against Chelsea and uncertainty over a new contract, Savage sees him as central to Liverpool’s future."}

Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and, in stoppage time, Dejan Lovren delivered them, spurred on by Jurgen Klopp’s frantic touch-line urgings and an intense Anfield atmosphere that included a prolonged “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and a minute’s silence for the Hillsborough anniversary. Klopp’s six-month tenure has already instilled his “turn doubters into believers” philosophy, yet defensive frailties (notably Alberto Moreno and elements of Sakho’s positioning) remain. Origi’s emergence, Emre Can’s strong display before injury and Coutinho’s flair were positives.

Greeks’ passivity is attributed to July’s bank closures and economic collapse, which appear to have convinced Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that “there is no alternative” (TINA) to the creditors’ terms. Tsipras remains personally popular even though fiscal austerity continues and bank restrictions have imposed damaging “monetary austerity,” leaving firms short of credit and threatening the retail sector’s crucial autumn ordering season. The bailout’s success now hinges on whether it can offer hope; many argue this requires creditors to cut Greece’s unsustainably large debt by 33–50 per cent, and that Brussels—especially Berlin—must grant such forgiveness without triumphalism if genuine recovery is to follow."}

Craig Venter (b. 1946) is a biologist–entrepreneur who repeatedly up-ended genomics.  \n• After Vietnam–era service he pursued research, joining the US National Institutes of Health, where he sped DNA decoding by sequencing the RNA messages cells already make.  \n• In 1992 he left NIH, founded The Institute for Genomic Research, and in 1995 produced the first complete genome of a free-living organism (Haemophilus influenzae).  \n• In 1998 he launched Celera Genomics, turning the Human Genome Project into a public-vs-private race; both sides published the human genome in 2001. His competitive tactics and data-access policies drew heavy criticism, yet they accelerated the field and made him wealthy.  \n• With independent resources he formed the J. Craig Venter Institute (2006) and spent more than a decade creating the first synthetic organism, “Synthia,” reported in Science.  \n• Venter also conducts a global ocean-sampling expedition aboard his yacht Sorcerer II to catalogue marine microbial genes.  \nHe argues that engineered microbes could inaugurate a new industrial era by producing fuels and trapping CO₂, although his high-profile style and claims continue to court controversy."}

The article rebuts Rios by noting: \n• George W. Bush’s Iraq war hardly proved male hormones safer; research shows men more prone to unnecessary risk, and history is full of male leaders whose testosterone-driven behavior (from wars to sex scandals) has impaired judgment.  \n• TIME recently praised Clinton for being “biologically primed” to lead now that she is post-menopausal, showing how hormone talk persists even in favorable coverage.\n\nBeneath these arguments lies a deeper problem: entrenched workplace bias against women.  Evidence cited includes more U.S. corporate directors named John, Robert, William or James than total women directors, and students calling male professors “genius” while labeling female professors merely “nice.”  Such bias, not biology, limits women’s advancement.\n\nThe piece argues that gender equality benefits everyone—companies with more female leaders earn more, children thrive with involved fathers, marriages strengthen when duties are shared, and diverse teams perform better.  Until stereotypes are dismantled, a woman presidential candidate like Clinton faces a steeper climb.\n\nRios says she would flee to Canada if a woman becomes president, apparently unaware Canada had a female prime minister, Kim Campbell, in 1993.
