The researchers suggest antibiotics may alter gut bacteria, increasing nutrient absorption and appetite, and warn that such effects could be contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic, underscoring the need for judicious antibiotic use in infancy. Previous studies also link early antibiotic exposure to eczema and digestive issues, and growing concerns about over-prescription include the rise of drug-resistant “superbugs.”","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

The research found no support for the idea that women are more reluctant than men to negotiate pay or afraid of defying stereotypes, and noted that men may simply be less likely to acknowledge failed requests. Differences by age showed parity in negotiation and success rates for both sexes under 40, suggesting younger women’s growing confidence may help close the gender pay gap.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Swansea, promoted in 2011 after narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, thrived under Roberto Martinez, Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup but have since “lost their way” amid constant managerial changes and insufficient player replacements.

Launches using more than 20 Soyuz rockets will put clusters of 32–36 satellites into 1,200 km orbits, yielding roughly 300 satellites on station by early 2021, over 600 by 2022 and 800+ by mid-decade. While rivals such as SpaceX and Boeing seek similar “mega-constellations,” OneWeb—backed by $1.7 billion in equity and pursuing UK licensing and financing—claims a first-mover edge. To address debris concerns, each satellite is designed to deorbit within two years and includes an adapter for potential retrieval by a chase vehicle.

Dortmund’s early dominance through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang threatened to derail Liverpool’s campaign, but Klopp invoked the spirit of Istanbul 2005, instilling belief that propelled a dramatic turnaround. The night combined colour, atmosphere and emotion—highlighted by an extended “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and a minute’s silence for Hillsborough—before Liverpool’s force of will broke Dortmund’s resolve. Klopp’s six-month tenure has already reshaped the team’s identity and rejuvenated supporters, even as defensive frailties remain. With Sevilla, Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk still in the draw, Liverpool now move into the semi-finals, edging closer to European silverware and a Champions League return.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

After signing in on a new device, users must enter their password plus a four-digit code sent to a trusted phone or via the Find My iPhone app; without it, they cannot access iCloud or make iTunes, iBooks or App Store purchases. A 14-character recovery key can restore access if a trusted device is lost, though critics warn it risks being forgotten or stolen. Previously, even with two-step authentication enabled, tools like Elcomsoft’s Phone Password Breaker could download full backups; its developer now admits Apple’s changes block that method and trigger email notifications when backups begin. While some security specialists welcome the improvement, they urge Apple—and other firms—to make two-factor authentication the default and increase user awareness.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Produced by Marie Gardent and colleagues at the University of Savoie using historical maps, aerial photos and satellite imagery verified by manual delineation, the survey shows that by 1985–86 area had already fallen to about 340 sq km despite a brief advance in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Retreat has been strongest in southern sectors—Belledonne’s glaciers have nearly vanished and Ecrins is receding over three times faster than Mont Blanc—likely due to lower elevations and drier, sunnier climate, whereas the northern Alps, which receive more precipitation and cloud cover, have seen less loss (La Mer de Glace declined from 31.5 sq km to just over 30 sq km). Similar accelerated retreat has also been reported elsewhere in the Alps.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Excessive drinking cost the U.S. over $220 billion annually and contributed to about 88,600 deaths in 2010.

Lewis at Oxford, published two books on the medieval longbow and advised on the Mary Rose raise, Hardy rose to fame as Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small (1978–1990), frequently portrayed Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt on screen, and later played Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films. Saddened to part with his treasured collection, he plans to continue television work despite retiring from the stage after a fall two years ago.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Rubio’s campaign has already received donor commitments exceeding the $47 million he’ll likely need to compete in a Republican primary crowded with well‐funded contenders.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Brown credits World Rugby’s online education modules for helping him recognise warning signs and prioritise long-term health, and says he will gradually progress through activities (starting with a 20-minute bike test) before resuming full training. As an ambassador for Land Rover’s “We Deal in Real” campaign, he urges teammates to be honest about symptoms and resist playing on when concussed.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

He attributes much of this drop to our constantly connected lives eroding the boundary between work, home and personal time, leaving less opportunity for intimacy. While living alone has also increased, Spiegelhalter and researcher Catherine Mercer note that late-night work emails and competing demands on our time mean that by bedtime people often remain too “plugged in” to focus solely on their partners.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}

Their precipitous decline is attributed to the government’s anti-corruption campaign, which ended lavish gifting of these dogs to officials, and recent bans on pets over 50 kg in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. An oversupply of cross-bred, low-quality mastiffs exacerbates the collapse: breeders unable to sell imperfect dogs offload them to abattoirs, while gangs steal healthy animals off the streets. Animal-welfare rescuers recently intercepted 20 mastiffs in cramped, food-and-water-deprived cages, one-third already dead, highlighting a wider crisis that may affect hundreds of animals. Originating as loyal herders in Tibet, these 80-kg dogs have also been deemed unsuitable for urban life amid China’s rapid urbanization.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-low","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-21","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"low"}
