{"timestamp":"2025-06-12","llm":"o3-pro","article_id":3,"summary":"A Finnish study of more than 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, reported in Pediatrics, compared their height and weight with antibiotic prescription records. By age two, 20 % of boys and 10 % of girls were overweight or obese, and infants given antibiotics in the first six months—or repeatedly before age two—were significantly more likely to be in this group. Boys showed the strongest effect and were also slightly taller than unmedicated peers. Although the research does not prove causation, the authors suggest antibiotics may kill gut bacteria that normally limit calorie absorption or curb appetite, thereby promoting weight gain. Lead author Dr Antti Saari warns that early and frequent antibiotic use could be fueling the global childhood-obesity epidemic and stresses more judicious prescribing. Previous work links infant antibiotics to eczema and digestive problems, and health officials already fear overuse is undermining the drugs’ effectiveness against infections."}

All nine firms deny giving “back-door” access; experts suggest access may be limited and court-ordered.  \n• U.S. officials call the leaks “extremely damaging” and say surveillance has prevented attacks, arguing full transparency would aid terrorists. President Obama states total privacy is incompatible with total security; Senator Dianne Feinstein says records are only queried for links to al-Qaeda or Iran.  \n• Data-protection laws mainly regulate companies, not governments; most corporate privacy policies allow disclosure when legally required. Because cloud data of users worldwide is often stored in the U.S., the Patriot Act and FISA Amendments let American authorities reach non-U.S. data with minimal transparency.  \n• Foreign reaction is uncertain: the U.K.’s GCHQ will not confirm or deny involvement; the EU Commission seeks details and stresses that national courts decide legality of data transfers.  \n• Privacy advocates say Prism shows that anyone using major online services may be monitored without recourse.

Alarm-symptom pathway: strict fast-track targets for obvious cancers.  \n2. Hospital-based “diagnosis centres”: rapid, multi-test work-ups for patients whose symptoms are concerning but unclear. By law, any physical illness must be investigated within 30 days of GP referral.  \n3. “Yes-no” centres: same-day tests/scans for patients with minor symptoms that rarely, but sometimes, hide serious disease.\n\nThe system reduces GP–specialist “ping-pong,” uses existing resources without a surge in referrals, and has led to markedly improved cancer survival, allowing Denmark to catch up with other Nordic countries.

Northern sectors, benefiting from higher peaks, more precipitation and cloud, have fared better; La Mer de Glace has declined only slightly (31.5 km² to just over 30 km²).  \n• The findings, presented at the AGU Fall Meeting, echo accelerated glacier loss seen elsewhere in the Alps."}

He was never paid, but the DEA repeatedly assured him he would receive U.S. citizenship.  \n\nRetired and in poor health, Toro still has neither a green card nor a passport; his last visa expired January 1, leaving him in the country illegally and unable to collect Social Security.

Former handler DEA agent Mike McManus, who once arrested trafficker George Jung, calls the situation “government bureaucracy at its worst,” and personally gave Toro $5,000 for medical bills.
