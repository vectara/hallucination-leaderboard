An OSV survey of 1,100 adults finds 31% of men and 75% of women have never washed their own car, and only 12% of those who do wash it regularly. Just 5% pay their children to help. Factors include shops opening on Sundays, live football on TV, the rise of hand\u2011washes and larger 4\u00d74s that are hard to clean. Around 15\u00a0million cars were owner\u2011washed last Easter\u2014often simply as an excuse to get out of the house. Regionally, Birmingham, Chelmsford and Sheffield lead in DIY washes; Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh trail. Audis, Toyotas and BMWs are most often self\u2011washed; Range Rovers, Peugeots and Mercedes least.
