The ASA is reviewing the complaints, TfL says it will adhere to CAP and ASA guidance on future ads, and hundreds are expected to protest in Hyde Park. The campaign sparked a social-media backlash and a debate on Good Morning Britain, where host Susanna Reid called the slogan “anxiety inducing” while Protein World’s head of global marketing, Richard Staveley, defended the unretouched image, revealed bomb threats against the company are under police investigation and vowed to maintain its marketing approach. The controversy unfolds amid booming UK protein-powder sales—rising from £73 million in 2007 to £170 million in 2012 and projected to reach £358 million by 2017—and has drawn both feminist criticism and support from figures like Katie Hopkins and Samantha Brick.","company":"openai","model_name":"o4-mini-high","date_code":"2025-04-16","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-07-22","temperature":1.0,"max_tokens":2048,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":"high"}
