Muto, who has made 37 appearances and scored 16 goals for FC Tokyo, earned 11 caps and one goal for Japan, graduated with an economics degree from Keio University two weeks ago, and has continued strong form this season with three goals in four games, helping his team sit third in the J‑League. While he called the offer an honour, he has not yet decided whether to join the Premier League side. Yokohama Rubber will become Chelsea’s official shirt sponsor from the 2015‑16 season under a five‑year, £200 million deal, with a possible two‑week pre‑season tour of Japan being considered.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-120b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

Depay, who has scored 20 goals in 26 league games this season and helped PSV clinch their first Eredivisie title in seven years, is praised for his pace, dribbling, powerful right foot and ability to cut inside from the left wing, drawing comparisons to Arjen Robben and a young Cristiano Ronaldo. Born in 1994, he progressed from VV Moordrecht to Sparta Rotterdam and joined PSV at 12, debuting in 2011 and signing his first professional contract in 2012, accumulating over 100 appearances. Internationally, van Gaal gave him his first Oranje call‑up in 2013 and included him in the 2014 World Cup squad, where he scored the winning goal against Australia and was nominated for the tournament’s Best Young Player award.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-120b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-07","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}
