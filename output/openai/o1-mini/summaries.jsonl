The initial coup in 1987 by indigenous Fijians overthrew an Indian-dominated government, leading to the temporary establishment of indigenous political supremacy. A subsequent coup in 2000, led by George Speight, resulted in the hostage-taking of Fiji\u2019s first ethnic Indian prime minister and his cabinet, severely damaging the economy and Fiji\u2019s international standing. Persistent tensions and divisions eventually led to a bloodless military takeover in 2006. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth in 2009 for lacking democratic progress but was reinstated after agreeing to free elections in 2014.
