The study, published in the medical journal Pediatrics, suggests that antibiotics might contribute to the obesity epidemic by affecting gut bacteria, which could increase food absorption and appetite. The Finnish researchers analyzed over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that those who had taken antibiotics as infants, especially if given repeatedly, were more likely to be overweight. Boys were particularly affected, showing both higher weight and slightly greater height compared to those who hadn't received antibiotics. The study highlights the need for judicious use of antibiotics in infancy due to their potential role in promoting obesity, alongside their established benefits to human health.

The map reveals clumps of dark matter, indicated in red, and less dense areas, shown in blue. The map's creation involved analyzing 130 million telescope images of galaxies, a process requiring significant computing power. The map allows astronomers to study galaxy formation and the nature of dark energy by observing the gravitational effects of dark matter, which makes up about 85 percent of all matter in the universe. The survey, now in its second year, uses gravitational lensing to detect dark matter's influence on light around galaxies.
