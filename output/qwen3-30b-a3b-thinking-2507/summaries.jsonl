A University of Edinburgh study found a history of police trouble was the strongest predictor of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18, and poorer youth were five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Extreme poverty increased the risk of being both a victim and perpetrator of crime. Boys were three times more likely than girls to engage in violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as those from affluent households to be involved in violent crime. Despite Scotland's reported crime rate at a 41-year low, the study found crime remains highly concentrated in the most deprived communities, with half of high-crime areas in the top 20% for chronic health problems and a third in the top 20% for unemployment. Researchers argued this concentration persists despite overall crime reduction, raising questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called its personal assistant ad (\"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup\") \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women,\" with chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath demanding clarification.

Another ad sought a \"sexy female driver\" for £40,000–£50,000 annually. Employment lawyer James Lynas stated such ads are \"clearly unlawful,\" as phrases like \"beautiful and attractive\" are discriminatory against older women, and male applicants could sue for sex discrimination. The agency's website claimed it is \"almost politically incorrect\" to request attractive workers, but the EHRC countered that \"first impressions count\" should focus on skills, not appearance.

The research challenges the assumption of pristine pre-European Amazon forests, indicating humans cultivated diverse plant species over 6,000 years through agroforestry focused on economically valuable trees (like palms), creating a \"prehistoric supermarket\" that may still influence Acre's remaining forest biodiversity.","company":"qwen","model_name":"qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking","date_code":"2507","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-09-29","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat","enable_thinking":true}

With doctors making up only about one in 10 of the workforce, more needs to come from other health staff, but funding is required. Unions warned against using the reshaping as a quick fix for NHS staffing shortages, stressing that it should not compromise doctor training quality or be funded by cutting support for existing staff.

Their market collapse is partly blamed on the government's anti-corruption crackdown, which ended the practice of giving them as bribes to officials, and recent bans on owning dogs over 50kg in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Breeders cross-bred the dogs for profit, leading to a glut of poor-quality specimens that cannot be sold. As a result, many are now being sent to slaughterhouses for cheap hotpots, with reports of dogs found in cramped cages without food or water, destined for meat and leather.
