Key points include:\n\n- **Decline in Car Washing**: A third of men and three-quarters of women in Britain have never washed their own car.\n- **Reasons for Decline**: Factors include shops being open on Sundays, more live football on TV, the rise of hand car washes, and the size of larger vehicles like 4x4s.\n- **Regional and Brand Differences**: Cars are most likely to be washed by their owners in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least likely in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh. Audi, Toyota, and BMW owners are more likely to wash their cars, while Range Rover, Peugeot, and Mercedes owners are less likely.\n- **Holiday Trends**: More people wash their cars during holidays, with 15 million cars cleaned during the recent Easter break, often as an excuse to get out of the house.\n- **Expert Opinion**: OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley attributes the decline to lack of time, larger cars, and the availability of automated and hand car wash services.\n\nOverall, the tradition of washing one's own car is waning due to lifestyle changes and convenience factors.", "company": "mistralai", "model_name": "Pixtral-Large-Instruct", "date_code": "2411", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
