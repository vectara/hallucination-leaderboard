Researchers suggest antibiotics may contribute to childhood obesity, similar to their use in fattening farm animals. The study, published in *Pediatrics*, analyzed over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds and found that one in five boys and one in ten girls were overweight or obese, with antibiotic use before six months or repeated prescriptions increasing the risk. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain and slightly taller after antibiotic exposure. While the study doesn't prove causation, potential mechanisms include altered gut bacteria affecting food absorption and appetite. Lead author Dr. Antti Saari emphasizes the need for judicious antibiotic use in infancy to address the childhood obesity epidemic.

Fleet Street, historically synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers, was dubbed \"the Street of Shame\" and was the pinnacle of a journalist's career. The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published there in 1702. At its height, nearly every national paper had offices within a half-mile radius, and the street was famous for its pubs and bars, where journalists socialized and sought stories. However, with the advent of television and social media, and the relocation of major newspapers to cheaper, computerised facilities, Fleet Street's prominence waned. By 1988, most national papers had moved away, and the area transformed into a hub for sandwich bars and other businesses. Sherriff and Smith reflect on their careers, the street's rich history, and its cultural significance, with Smith becoming a freelance journalist and Sherriff writing his memoirs. The passage concludes by marking the end of an era, emphasizing Fleet Street's enduring legacy in British journalism.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-a", "date_code": "03-2025", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya have contributed to public fatigue on the topic.

Despite global instability, the UK has significantly cut its armed forces, reducing the Army from 102,000 to 82,000, the Royal Navy to 19 warships, and the RAF to seven front-line fast jet squadrons. The UK has fallen from the fourth to the sixth largest defence spender globally, and is unlikely to meet NATO's 2% GDP spending target, risking credibility with the US. Further cuts are expected, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing potential reductions of \u00a32-3 billion annually.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Fishing Industry's Role in Brexit**: Fishing regions strongly supported leaving the EU, driven by dissatisfaction with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which they view as detrimental to UK interests.\n\n2. **House of Lords Report**: The report warns that the fishing industry, though small (0.5% of GDP, 12,000 jobs), must not be marginalized in Brexit negotiations. It emphasizes the need for continued market access to the EU, which may require trade-offs, such as allowing EU boats to fish in UK waters.\n\n3. **Shared Waters and Trade**: Most commercial fish stocks are in shared waters, and the UK exports the majority of its fish to the EU while importing much of the fish consumed domestically. This interdependence complicates negotiations.\n\n4. **CFP Retention and International Obligations**: The report suggests retaining some CFP elements, like science-based quotas, and highlights ongoing international obligations to cooperate with neighboring states.\n\n5. **Regional Management Concerns**: Leaving the EU could lead to four separate fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, potentially creating inconsistencies.\n\n6. **Industry Optimism**: Despite concerns, the fishing industry remains optimistic, citing recent quota increases under the CFP as a positive sign. They believe Brexit offers a chance to regain control over UK waters and enhance sustainable management.\n\n7. **Government Response**: The government acknowledges the opportunity to review fisheries management post-Brexit, aiming for fair access, sustainable stocks, and a healthy marine environment, while seeking maximum trade freedom with the EU.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-a", "date_code": "03-2025", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Dark matter, comprising at least 80% of the universe's matter, cannot be directly observed but is detected via gravitational lensing. The map reveals clumps of dark matter, with red indicating higher concentrations and blue showing less. The DES seeks to understand dark matter's role in galaxy formation and to probe dark energy, which drives the universe's accelerated expansion.
