Repeated prescriptions before the age of two further increased the odds of being a fat toddler, with boys being particularly prone to weight gain. The study suggests that antibiotics may contribute to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic by killing beneficial gut bacteria that normally help process food, potentially leading to increased appetite and more available food for the body.

Investing Solutions has been receiving housing benefits by finding properties for single homeless men, primarily over the age of 35. The company profits by charging housing benefits for each tenant rather than passing the bulk of the rent to private landlords. This practice has led to higher total benefit payouts compared to the rent paid to landlords, generating significant profits. For instance, Investing Solutions claimed £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants, while the landlord received £1,150, resulting in an annual gross profit of £11,568 from one property. Critics, including a homeless group and a homeless charity, argue this is exploitative and a \"new low.\" Despite this, neither the charity nor the company is acting illegally. Fresh Start Housing claims to refer clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords.

The study, known as the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, tracked 4,300 young people since 1998 and revealed that poverty significantly increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. Specifically, poorer young people were about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their wealthier peers. The study also highlighted that people living in extreme poverty were more likely to be both victims and perpetrators of crime. Gender was identified as a powerful predictor of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds being twice as likely as those from affluent households to be involved in violent crime, even after accounting for other risk factors. The findings suggest a destructive cycle where poverty increases the risks of violence, and contact with the juvenile justice system further exacerbates these risks. Additionally, another study by the University of Edinburgh indicated that despite overall falling crime rates, areas with the highest chronic crime rates remain in the most deprived communities, raising questions about inequality and its tackling by the Scottish government. The Scottish government, however, asserts that it is making Scotland safer with a record low in crime and increased investment in tackling poverty and inequalities.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-micro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A pilot scheme in Cwm Cynon and Castell-nedd focuses on patients whose family doctors suspect cancer but who show no urgent signs or symptoms. This initiative follows visits to Denmark where health board officials observed improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that patients in Wales without clear symptoms may wait too long for a diagnosis, not fitting easily into specific treatment pathways. This results in doctors repeatedly referring patients for multiple tests over weeks. Consequently, there is a fear that too many patients start treatment when their cancer has already progressed or is no longer curable. Forty doctors in Cwm Cynon will refer patients to a diagnostic center at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, within seven days, aiming to see and test around six patients weekly on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with concerning symptoms in the Cwm Taf area receive a diagnosis. The goal is to reach the majority of patients without obvious symptoms sooner. Similar clinics will be established in Ysbyty Castell-nedd Port Talbot as part of another pilot scheme by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board. These trials were developed over the past 12 months after Welsh experts returned from Aarhus, Denmark, which established diagnostic centers due to high cancer survival rates. Dr. Gareth Davies from Cancer Wales Network believes this plan will both ease patients' minds and speed up the process. Gareth Jordan, a family doctor in Aberdâr, believes the pilot scheme could significantly impact patients' lives by ensuring quicker diagnosis if they have cancer. If successful, the six-month pilot in Cwm Cynon will lead to the same service being offered by other health boards in the area.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-micro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite a High Court refusal to impose an injunction initially, PJS successfully appealed, leading to the current legal situation.

This move has drawn criticism, especially as both major party leaders had pledged to freeze prices. Prime Minister David Cameron has personally intervened, urging First Great Western (FGW) to urgently review its decision to nearly double fares on the London to Cotswolds route, which passes through his Witney constituency. Cameron has promised to freeze fares for the next parliament, and Labour has also pledged to cap price hikes. The planned fare increases have angered constituents, leading to Cameron's direct request to FGW. Train companies have three windows annually to increase unregulated fares, which constitute about half of their revenue. FGW has defended the hike, stating it aims to align the North Cotswolds route with other services, while also offering cheaper advanced single tickets. Other notable hikes include a 24.5% increase on an off-peak return between Stafford and Liverpool with Virgin, and a 22% rise on a first-class day return from Manchester to Stoke. Virgin has argued that most of its hikes affect cheaper \"Virgin trains-only fares,\" which are at least 20% cheaper than rival firm tickets, and that its overall fare increase is below the industry average.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-micro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

These tests identify specific genetic markers in the tumor to determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, cancer cells are sent to a lab for screening, allowing women to know within days if they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the risk of recurrence is as low as five percent, comparable to or better than the odds for those undergoing chemotherapy. While chemotherapy is routinely given to most breast cancer patients post-surgery to prevent recurrence, it comes with severe side effects. However, experts believe that for some women, chemotherapy may not be necessary due to a lower risk of recurrence. The new test, called EndoPredict, can show a low score, allowing patients to opt out of chemotherapy. These tests are currently available privately at a cost of about £2,500, but there is hope they may become available on the NHS. Surgeons and breast specialists argue that the cost of the test is offset by the savings from not administering chemotherapy. A patient's story illustrates how the test helped her avoid chemotherapy, which she dreaded more than surgery, due to its potential impact on her ability to care for her children.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-micro-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
