Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls, with boys being three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Household poverty is a significant factor in youth offending, even when other risk factors are considered. The study also found that people living in extreme poverty are more likely to be both victims and perpetrators of crime. The research tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 and was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government. Despite the overall decrease in crime rates in Scotland, the study suggests that the most deprived communities continue to experience the highest rates of crime.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The exercise, named \"Dynamic Mongoose,\" involves 10 NATO warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, searching for a German U-boat, U33, commanded by Kai Nicklesdorf. The U-boat's mission is to simulate an attack on the USS Vicksburg and an oil tanker. The exercise highlights the difficulty of locating submarines underwater and the technological advancements of Russian submarines, which are described as the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world.\"\n\nFor the first time, NATO has deployed underwater drones to assist in tracking the ocean floor, offering advantages such as lower cost, reduced risk to personnel, and persistent surveillance. Maritime patrol aircraft, like the French Atlantique, play a crucial role in anti-submarine warfare, though Britain lacks its own, making it reliant on allies for such capabilities. This absence is identified as a significant vulnerability, potentially allowing Russian submarines to monitor the UK's nuclear deterrent.

A pilot scheme in Cynon Valley and Neath is focusing on patients whose family doctors suspect have cancer but show no urgent signs or symptoms. This follows a visit by doctors to Denmark to see their diagnostic systems. Cwm Taf Health Board officials saw that the health service in Denmark had improved cancer survival rates. The concern is that a patient in Wales without clear symptoms waits too long for a diagnosis because they do not \"fit easily\" into any specific treatment pathway. This means family doctors refer the patient back and forth to get several tests, which takes several weeks. Therefore, the fear is that too many patients start treatment when their cancer has progressed or cannot be improved. Forty doctors in Cynon Valley who believe something might be wrong can refer the patient to a diagnostic center at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant within seven days. It is estimated that about six patients per week will be seen and given different tests, with the hope that this will happen on the same day. Currently, only 35% of patients with worrying symptoms are diagnosed in the Cwm Taf area. Doctors therefore want to reach most of the patients without such obvious symptoms sooner. A similar clinic will be established at Neath Port Talbot Hospital as part of another trial by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board. The trials have been developed over the past 12 months since experts from Wales returned from Aarhus. Denmark established diagnostic centers after concerns that the country was lagging behind in cancer survival rates. According to Dr. Gareth Davies, Director of the Wales Cancer Network Liaison, the scheme will reassure patients but also speed up the process. \"If the family doctor sees a patient who is not sure what is wrong but is worried and feels something is wrong, it will give the family doctor the opportunity to refer the patient directly to the clinic and mean the patient will be seen quickly and hopefully diagnosed.\" Gareth Jordan, a family doctor in Aberdare, says the pilot scheme could make a big difference to patients' lives. \"I would say, 'I've seen this man, he's lost a lot of weight... might not send him off for specialist tests or if we did, the tests would be given in order of likelihood'.

Fishing regions in the UK, which largely voted to leave the EU, are concerned about being marginalized in Brexit negotiations. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which ensures equal access to fishing grounds for all member states, is often criticized by the UK fishing industry. Despite this, the House of Lords European Union Committee warns that the UK might need to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of a Brexit deal. The report highlights that while the fishing industry is small in terms of GDP and employment, it must not be marginalized. The shared nature of commercial fish stocks between the UK and other EU states complicates the issue, as does the need for continued market access for UK fish exports. The report suggests that the UK may face trade-offs, such as allowing more EU access to UK waters in return for continued tariff-free sales to the EU. It also recommends retaining elements of the CFP post-Brexit and ensuring that fishing quotas are based on scientific advice. The potential fragmentation of fisheries management into four different regimes in the UK is noted as a concern.

Prime Minister David Cameron has requested First Great Western (FGW) to urgently review its decision to almost double some fares on the London to Cotswolds route, which passes through his Witney constituency. Passengers from Charlbury to London could face an 87% increase, rising from £33.30 to £62.40. Train companies have three windows annually to increase unregulated fares, which make up around half of their total revenue. FGW insists the change is to align the North Cotswolds route with other services and is offering cheaper advanced single tickets. Other significant hikes include an off-peak first-class single from Crewe to Northampton on London Midlands, rising from £30 to £37, and an anytime return between Stafford and Liverpool on Virgin, increasing from £26.50 to £33.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Heavy drinking is defined as more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month. The increase is largely due to rising rates among women as social norms change. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study also found that the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men. The increase in excessive drinking is attributed to cultural and economic factors, such as changed social norms, the influx of wealthy professionals in cities, and weakened alcohol control policies.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In 356 days, they have covered almost 7,000 miles and visited 16 countries, living on less than three euros each per day. They minimize costs by camping, using hosting websites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers, and relying on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. Their primary expense is food, which costs 2.74 euros each per day. They eat a simple diet of pasta, bread, rice, eggs, milk, seasonal fruits, and vegetables, and supplement their food by picking wild fruits and dumpster diving where applicable. They started their journey in London and have since traveled through France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey, with plans to continue into Asia, across the Pacific, and eventually cycle the length of the American continent.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Research indicates that the number of times Britons are having sex each month has been decreasing since the emergence of the internet. According to Spiegelhalter's book \"Sex by Numbers,\" a typical heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, compared to four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes this decline to the erosion of boundaries between home, work, and the outside world, leading to busier lives and less time spent with partners. Additionally, the constant connectivity and competing demands on time, such as checking emails late into the evening, make it difficult for couples to focus on each other.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This decline is partly due to the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown, which has made gifting these dogs to officials taboo. Additionally, bans on owning dogs over 50 kg in several cities have impacted the breed's popularity. As a result, many Tibetan mastiffs are being sent to slaughterhouses, where their meat is used in cheap hotpots, and their skin for leather products. Animal welfare workers have rescued some of these dogs, finding them in poor conditions. The breed's decline is also attributed to cross-breeding and the realization that these dogs are not suited to urban living.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

They surveyed 2,000 people to identify the top ten everyday emergencies causing undue stress, such as not being able to sleep (46%), losing keys (37%), and running out of phone battery (31%). Design groups from Makerversity were tasked with creating prototype products to solve these issues. Three products were shortlisted: \n\n1. **Snooze**: An alarm clock that connects with a phone to silence notifications for a good night's sleep.\n2. **Forget Me Lock**: A device that attaches to a key and changes color (green for open, red for locked) to indicate if the door is locked.\n3. **Nipper**: The world's smallest mobile phone charger that uses household batteries to provide a phone boost.\n\nThe public can vote for their favorite prototype on Twitter using the hashtag #everydayfix. The product with the most retweets by April 40 will enter a Kickstarter campaign for funding and development. Other notable prototypes that did not make the final shortlist included a parking pin to alert users when a parking space is free and a helmet with bone conduction headphones for cycling directions.", "company": "amazon", "model_name": "nova-lite-v1:0", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
