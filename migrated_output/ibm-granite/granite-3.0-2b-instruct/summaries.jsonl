The Commission suggested joining individual electoral registers run by councils to identify duplicate entries. Labour cautioned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, with 68.7% actually voting, the highest turnout since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to vote after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April, with 2.9 million applications received. Concerns about duplicate applications persist due to the lack of a direct link between electoral registers and the online registration service. The Commission estimated that 30% to 70% of applications may be duplicates, causing administration and financial burdens. The Commission recommended clearer information on registration sites, including a verification function, and urgent action to address the issue. Despite efforts to discourage re-registration, many people submitted another application due to the ease of online registration.
