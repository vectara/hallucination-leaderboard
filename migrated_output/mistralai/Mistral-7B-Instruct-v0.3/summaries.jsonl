The lasers would be mounted on satellites covered in mirrors to harvest sunlight and convert it into laser light, which would then be used to boost the energy received by solar panels on Earth. Initial trials in Scotland have been successful, and Dr Quarterman plans to move the trials to Portugal.\n\nThe Tokyo researchers propose a laser system to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) for shooting down pieces of debris in Earth orbit. This system would use a telescope already mounted on the ISS to find and target small pieces of debris up to 62 miles away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push the debris into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. However, neither of these laser systems would be powerful enough to be turned into weapons.

Diagnosis centres, set up in 2007, where patients with symptoms GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them.\n3. \"Yes-no\" centres for patients with minor symptoms, which offer a simple test or scan to identify problems quickly.\n\nThe changes have not resulted in a surge of GP referrals but have improved the organization of patient diagnosis within existing resources.

Dr Quarterman's idea is to use space lasers to convert sunlight into energy for powering homes, particularly in Scotland and disaster-hit areas. The lasers would be mounted on satellites covered in mirrors to harvest sunlight and convert it into laser light, which would then be used to boost the energy received by solar panels on Earth. Initial trials in Scotland have been successful, and Dr Quarterman plans to move the trials to Portugal.\n\nThe Tokyo researchers propose a laser system to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) for shooting down pieces of debris in Earth orbit. This system would use a telescope already mounted on the ISS to find and target small pieces of debris up to 62 miles away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push the debris into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. However, neither of these laser systems would be powerful enough to be turned into weapons.

The study has been published in the Scottish Justice Matters journal and has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Scottish government.

The wide-leg trouser can be intimidating, especially for shorter individuals, but pairing it with high-heeled shoes and simple tops can help create a flattering and confident look. Denim is considered the easiest way to achieve this trend, with brands like Gucci and Topshop offering denim versions. Other designers, such as Celine and Stella McCartney, have showcased dressier versions of the wide-leg trouser. For a more affordable option, Topshop's Miller jean is recommended.
