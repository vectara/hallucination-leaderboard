The study, which analyzed data from over 12,000 healthy two-year-olds, found that repeated antibiotic prescriptions before the age of two also increased the likelihood of being overweight. Boys were particularly prone to weight gain after being given antibiotics. The researchers suggest that antibiotics may contribute to weight gain by killing off beneficial gut bacteria, freeing up more food for the body and increasing appetite. The study's findings highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy, as excessive use may contribute to the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
