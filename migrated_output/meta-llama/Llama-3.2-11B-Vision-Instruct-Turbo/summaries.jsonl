The report argues that this would be the largest social house building programme since the 1970s and would give the economy a kickstart. However, Labour has criticized the proposal, saying it would \"drive out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" and create segregated communities. The report's author, Neil O'Brien, argues that social housing would still exist in expensive areas, but in smaller quantities, and that the overall number of people waiting for social housing could be reduced by 500,000. The government has said that councils can already choose to sell off high-value social homes, but Labour has called for a different approach, including using a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes.", "company": "meta-llama", "model_name": "Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This led to the creation of Celera Genomics, a commercial company that successfully mapped the human genome in 2001.
