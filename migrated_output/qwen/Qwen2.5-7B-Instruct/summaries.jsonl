The study tracked these trends at the county level and noted that while the percentage of people drinking alcohol remained stable, the rates of heavy drinking and binge drinking increased. Factors contributing to this trend include changing social norms, increased affordability of alcohol, and more aggressive alcohol advertising.

Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.\n3. A history of police involvement is the strongest predictor of young people not being in education, employment, or training by age 18.\n4. Poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts.\n5. People living in extreme poverty are more likely to be both victims and perpetrators of crime.\n6. Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts, and girls from poorer backgrounds are twice as likely as those from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime.\n\nThe study highlights how poverty perpetuates a cycle of violence and criminal behavior, with contact with the juvenile justice system further increasing these risks.

The PDP lost control of several key northern states and the oil-rich Adamawa state, while retaining power in the oil hub of Rivers State and the southeast. This shift signals a decline for the PDP, which previously dominated national politics. The APC's victory is particularly notable given their failure to win any of Nigeria's major oil-producing states, which could pose challenges for the new president-elect, Muhammadu Buhari. The elections were generally more peaceful than in previous years, though there were instances of violence, especially in the south. The PDP's loss is attributed to voter fatigue and corruption allegations, leading to calls for introspection and potential leadership changes within the party.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
