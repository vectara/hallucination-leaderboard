Also, if a child had multiple prescriptions for antibiotics before the age of two, they were more likely to be overweight.

Apparently, he's trying to make these portraits less awkward by having the fathers do something a bit unusual—leaping into the air while the daughters just stand there smiling and looking at the camera. It's from his latest book, which seems to be titled something like \"Daughter and Salary Man\" in English.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the idea is to let the fathers, who usually have to act serious, show their fun side by pretending to be heroes jumping into the sky. The term \"salary man\" might refer to the fathers wearing suits in these photos, which are sharply dressed, while the daughters are in more casual clothing. The backgrounds are various Japanese landmarks, which adds to the setting.\n\nThe photos seem to generate a lot of online interest because of their quirky nature. Some of the fathers look pretty energetic in their jumps, while others, especially the older ones, might look a bit pained, which probably adds to the humor or realism of the images.

But don't get too excited; these aren't the kind of lasers you see in sci-fi movies blowing up planets or villains. Instead, he's exploring the idea of using space lasers to power homes.\n\nHere's how it works: Satellites equipped with mirrors would orbit the Earth, capturing sunlight and converting it into laser light. Then, using semiconductors, this light would be transformed into energy and beamed back down to Earth. The goal is to enhance solar power, possibly making it viable even in places like Scotland, which isn't exactly known for its abundant sunshine. Additionally, this technology could quickly restore power to areas hit by disasters.\n\nDr. Quarterman envisions these lasers boosting the energy received by solar panels. He's already had successful trials in Scotland and is planning to move further tests to Portugal.

So, it was a big deal in the early days of personal computing.\n\nNow, it was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak, who's often called \"Woz.\" He's an American inventor, engineer, programmer, philanthropist, and entrepreneur. He was born on August 11, 1950. So, he's got a pretty impressive resume beyond just the Apple II.\n\nSteve Jobs, who's probably more well-known to many people, also played a role in the development of the Apple II. Specifically, he oversaw the design of the computer's foam-molded plastic case. So, while Wozniak was the main designer, Jobs was involved in the aesthetics and perhaps the overall presentation of the product.\n\nThere's also mention of someone named Rod Holt, who developed the switching power supply for the Apple II.

Let me try to sum it up, focusing on the main points.\n\nFirst, the poverty rate in 2011 was 15%, which means that 46.2 million Americans were living in poverty. That's important because it stayed the same as the previous year, after three years of increases. So, it's like the poverty rate leveled off for a moment.\n\nNext, the median income for households in the US dropped by 1.5% in real terms. That means, after adjusting for inflation, families were earning less than the year before. The poverty threshold for a family of four was $23,021 in 2011, which is the minimum income level before a family is considered poor.\n\nAlso, the Gini index, which measures income inequality, increased by 1.6% in 2011. That's notable because it was the first increase since 1993. So, income inequality got worse that year.\n\nOn a slightly positive note, the percentage of Americans without health insurance decreased to 15.7% from 1", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "QwQ-32B-Preview", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

A expert, Professor David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University, talked about this in his book \"Sex by Numbers.\" He pointed out that the frequency of sex among British couples has been decreasing since the internet became popular. In the past, couples used to have sex five times a month in 1990 and four times in 2000, but now it's down to three times a month.\n\nProfessor Spiegelhalter suggests that one reason for this decline could be that people are always checking their emails and are constantly connected, which doesn't leave much quiet time for intimacy with their partners. He mentions that in the past, there was a clear separation between public and private lives, but now everything is mixed up because of technology.\n\nAnother possible factor is that more people are living alone, but Spiegelhalter thinks a more likely explanation is that better technological connections have made our lives busier, and the boundaries between home, work, and the outside world have blurred.

But now, they're so unpopular that some are being sent to slaughterhouses, and their meat is ending up in cheap hotpot dishes.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this big change is the Chinese government's anti-corruption crackdown. Earlier, wealthy businessmen would give these prized mastiffs to officials hoping to influence their decisions. But with the anti-corruption drive, people are too scared to give or accept such expensive gifts.\n\nAlso, several Chinese cities have banned owning dogs over 50 kg, which includes these big Tibetan mastiffs.
