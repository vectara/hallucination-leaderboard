For decades, Fleet Street housed nearly all major national newspapers and was a symbol of journalistic prestige, dating back to the first British daily newspaper in 1702. At its peak, it was central to public information dissemination before the rise of television and social media. The area was known for its vibrant culture of pubs, printing presses, and camaraderie, though it also faced criticism for its male-dominated and alcohol-fueled environment. Over time, media tycoons like Rupert Murdoch relocated operations to modern facilities in the 1980s, leading to the decline of Fleet Street as a newspaper hub. Today, most former newspaper buildings serve other purposes. Reflecting on their careers, Sherriff and Smith express pride in their connection to Fleet Street's storied past, even as they transition to new ventures.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Poverty and Crime**: Children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action for the same crimes as their better-off peers. Poverty increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls and exacerbates the risk of offending.\n\n2. **Predictors of Negative Outcomes**: A history of police contact strongly predicts whether a young person is not in education, employment, or training by age 18. Poorer youth are five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than wealthier peers.\n\n3. **Gender and Violence**: Boys are three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer households are twice as likely as affluent girls to be involved in violent crime, even when accounting for factors like truancy and substance abuse.\n\n4. **Crime Concentration**: Despite Scotland’s overall reduction in crime rates, high-crime areas remain concentrated in the most deprived communities, which also face chronic health issues and unemployment.\n\n5. **Systemic Challenges**: Researchers argue that contact with the justice system may inadvertently reinforce conditions that perpetuate violence and inequality. Lead researcher Prof Lesley McAra notes the justice system risks reproducing poverty-related risks.\n\n6. **Government Response**: The Scottish government highlights its efforts to reduce crime, with recorded crime at a 41-year low, but acknowledges ongoing challenges in addressing inequality and poverty.\n\nThe study underscores the persistent link between deprivation and crime, questioning whether current policies adequately address systemic inequality.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "qwen-max", "date_code": "2025-01-25", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Despite the backlash, Brand has addressed the hypocrisy claims in the past, acknowledging his wealth and fame while emphasizing the need for systemic change and personal growth. He argues that revolution involves both individual and collective transformation, and that his privilege does not negate the reality of economic inequality and ecological concerns.

Craig Venter, a biologist and entrepreneur, played a pivotal role in accelerating the mapping of the human genome, turning it into a competitive race and sparking controversy within the scientific community. Known for his lack of modesty and significant wealth, Venter's innovations in genomic research significantly sped up the overall process. After the human genome project, he pursued the creation of synthetic life, achieving a breakthrough with the organism Synthia, developed at his institute and published in *Science*. Inspired by his experiences as a medic in the Vietnam War, where he developed a sense of urgency about life, Venter transitioned from medical practice to research, eventually joining the US National Institute of Health. There, he embraced automated gene-decoding technology and revolutionized the field by focusing on messenger RNA to identify active genes. Venter faced criticism from figures like James Watson, prompting him to leave NIH in 1992 to establish a private research institute. Later, in 1998, he challenged the scientific establishment by founding Celera Genomics to sequence the human genome in just three years, succeeding alongside the public project by 2001. Despite backlash over his methods, Venter gained financial independence, enabling him to pursue ambitious projects like creating synthetic life and cataloging marine microbial genomes aboard his yacht, Sorcerer II.

The protective effect against breast cancer was immediate and lasted up to 15 years. Women with BRCA1 mutations face a 50-80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a heightened risk of ovarian cancer. The study suggests oophorectomy should be considered as part of treatment discussions for BRCA mutation carriers. Genetic testing is available for those at risk, and the procedure is particularly effective for women with estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer.

While a knee injury has reduced her riding in recent years, she remains an enthusiastic equestrienne, frequently visiting her Windsor stables and taking an active interest in her horses and ponies. She breeds Fell ponies and Highland ponies, continuing a lifelong tradition of horse breeding. Her first pony, Peggy, was a Shetland given to her at age four, and her stables have housed various horses over the decades. Fell ponies, like her mount, are an ancient, hardy breed from Cumbria, historically valued for their strength and versatility. Today, the Queen’s involvement in breeding and riding horses reflects her lifelong devotion to equestrian pursuits.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "qwen-max", "date_code": "2025-01-25", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

While the price seems like a bargain, the flat requires extensive modernization and lease extension negotiations with the current freeholder, likely the Welcome Trust.

Despite living in India for decades, Ram and others like him have been denied citizenship rights, including the ability to own property, vote in state elections, or work in state government, due to disputes over Kashmir's status and fears of upsetting the demographic balance in India's only Muslim-majority state. Classified as refugees, most WPRs have never visited Pakistan and live in poverty, with limited opportunities for education and employment. However, hope for change has arisen after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won a share of power in Kashmir's state government. The BJP has pledged to address the WPRs' plight by granting them state-subject rights, potentially allowing them to integrate fully. Veteran activist Labha Ram Gandhi warns that the community is prepared to protest if their demands are ignored.

City's Brandon Barker and Bersant Celina had limited impact, and Kean Bryan missed a key chance after returning from injury.

Research shows that the average heterosexual couple now has sex three times a month, down from four in 2000 and five in 1990. Possible reasons for this decline include technological connectivity blurring boundaries between work and private life, busier schedules, and increased time spent checking emails or being connected to devices. This leaves less time for partners to focus on each other, with sex becoming a lower priority. Other factors, such as more people living alone, were also mentioned, but Spiegelhalter emphasizes the impact of constant connectivity on relationships.", "company": "qwen", "model_name": "qwen-max", "date_code": "2025-01-25", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

Previously used for bribing officials, demand for the dogs plummeted as anti-corruption measures discouraged such gifts. Additionally, breed-specific bans in major cities and unsuitable living conditions in urban areas further reduced their appeal. Overbreeding and cross-breeding have led to a surplus of low-quality mastiffs that cannot be sold, with many being sent to slaughterhouses for meat or leather. Recently, welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs destined for a slaughterhouse, highlighting the breed's grim fate as hundreds face similar outcomes.
