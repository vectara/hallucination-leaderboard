Further controversies included the 2009 “lie‑gate” involving Hamilton and Dave Ryan. Ron Dennis, who took over after Marlboro’s intervention, steered the team through its early dominance, the Honda and Mercedes partnerships, and returned to leadership after the 2013 slump, insisting that success will return. Alonso re‑joined in 2015 hoping the renewed Honda partnership would restore championship prospects, and Dennis remains optimistic that the current car and future Honda engines will enable McLaren to challenge Mercedes and reclaim titles.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

The charity Fresh Start Housing, established by Patel in 2010 and based in the same storage‑unit building, sources clients from London homeless charities and refers them to both Investing Solutions and private landlords, claiming it is an independent charity with its own trustees. Despite no illegal activity, critics—including a homeless group and the charity Crisis—label the partnership a “new low,” citing poor housing conditions (e.g., Nigel McCann’s unsanitary accommodations) and the agency’s focus on profit over people. Nearly half of the benefit money paid to Investing Solutions over two years came from Wandsworth Council (£2.1 m), which maintains a private‑sector housing team, while Fresh Start reports having housed 788 homeless people overall and 222 in the last year, though it cannot disclose how many were placed with Investing Solutions.

A history of police trouble is the strongest predictor of a youth not being in education, employment or training by age 18, and poorer young people are about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision. Household poverty also increases offending likelihood, with extreme poverty linked to both victimisation and perpetration. Parallel research by AQMeN shows that the recent decline in Scotland’s crime rates has not reached the most deprived communities, where high crime correlates with chronic health problems and unemployment, underscoring that crime remains concentrated among the poor.

By comparing full‑time and part‑time workers separately, the researchers ruled out pay‑gap effects and controlled for employer size, industry, parent status and qualifications. The data came from the 2013‑14 Australian workplace relations survey, the only systematic record of pay‑rise requests. Andrew Oswald noted the surprise at the findings, suggesting possible discrimination and that men may hide failed requests while women are more open. Age analysis revealed that under‑40 men and women ask for and get raises at the same rate, indicating a shift in negotiating behaviour, a point highlighted by Dr Amanda Goodall who sees young women’s improving negotiation success as a positive trend.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

Violence at polling stations—66 incidents, mainly in Rivers and other southern states—was higher than in the presidential poll, though overall the elections were relatively peaceful.

While the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been criticised as a disaster for Britain, the industry sees Brexit as a chance to regain control of UK waters and become a leading fish‑exporter like Norway. The report highlights that UK fishing is a small part of GDP but must not be sidelined, and that most commercial stocks are shared with EU states, with the UK largely exporting fish to the EU and importing much for domestic consumption. Successful industry will need continued market access, potentially requiring trade‑offs such as EU demands for greater UK water access in exchange for zero‑tariff sales. The report recommends retaining many CFP elements, basing quotas on science, and maintaining international cooperation, warning that leaving the EU could split the CFP framework into four separate regimes. Despite concerns, industry leaders remain optimistic, citing recent EU quota increases for plaice, haddock, and prawns and the prospect of full control over the 200‑mile exclusive economic zone, while the government stresses that Brexit offers an opportunity to review fisheries management for fair access, sustainability, and a healthy marine environment.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

Labour’s Cat Smith cautioned against making it harder for young voters to register, noting that the 8 June election saw a record 46.8 million registered (up 500 000 from 2015) and a 68.7 % turnout, the highest since 1997, driven by a surge of 2.9 million applications after the snap poll call and before the 22 May deadline. Many constituencies, especially those with large student populations, saw electorates rise over 10 %. However, the lack of a shared database between the online registration service and local registers means duplicate applications are common—estimated at 30–70 % in some areas—causing administrative and financial strain. The watchdog called for clearer registration guidance, a verification function used in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, and for people registered in two seats to pre‑select which one they will vote in. While some dual registration is lawful for local elections, voting twice in a general election remains an offence punishable by an unlimited fine, and the report urged police to investigate suspected cases.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

Pring’s wife, Ganna Ziuzina (Anna), 19 years his junior, had returned to a restaurant for a missing glove and was later found to have sold his Range Rover, liquidated flat contents, moved funds from his bank account, and claimed the first £200,000 of his estate, while computer records revealed an affair with a Ukrainian man. Family members and close friend Peter Clifford asserted that the couple’s online‑met, quickly married relationship and Ziuzina’s false teacher claim (she was actually a lap dancer) pointed to a staged hit‑and‑run to inherit his wealth. Ukrainian police initially closed the case but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry; Det Con Jonathan Watts reported the vehicle had no lights, was speeding at 75 mph, and witnesses described the killing as deliberate.

Yashin says the opposition will seek donations to expand the initial 2,000‑copy print run, but publishers fear backlash and the public’s appetite for the facts remains uncertain.

Born in 1946, Venter’s early life surfing and service as an orderly in Vietnam instilled a sense of urgency that drove his research career, leading him from NIH work in the 1980s to founding the Institute for Genomic Research in 1992 and, in 1995, publishing the first complete genome of *Haemophilus influenzae*.

The report notes that the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been seen as disastrous for Britain, yet many fishers view Brexit as an opportunity to regain control of UK waters and become a leading fish‑exporter like Norway, though continued market access to the EU will likely require concessions such as allowing EU vessels greater access to UK waters. It recommends retaining many CFP elements post‑Brexit, basing quotas on scientific advice, and maintaining international cooperation, while warning that the UK could end up with four separate fisheries regimes if the CFP framework collapses.

Craig Venter, a biologist turned entrepreneur, famously accelerated the human genome project by turning it into a competitive race, earning both acclaim and criticism for his aggressive, privately funded approach; after publishing the human genome, he shifted focus to creating the first synthetic organism, Synthia, which appeared in *Science* in 2006, and has since led the J. Craig Venter Institute in pioneering synthetic biology. Born in 1946, Venter’s early life in Southern California and service as a naval orderly in Vietnam instilled a sense of urgency that drove his rapid adoption of automated sequencing technology in 1987 and his breakthrough strategy of targeting RNA to speed gene discovery, a move that shocked peers like James Watson and prompted his departure from the NIH in 1992 to establish the Institute for Genomic Research. In 1995 he released the first complete genome of *Haemophilus influenzae*, and in 1998 founded Celera Genomics to finish the human genome in three years, a venture that, despite controversy over data access, secured him substantial wealth and independence. Venter also launched the oceanic “genetic treasure hunt” aboard his yacht Sorcerer II to sequence marine microbes, aiming to deepen understanding of gene evolution and to harness synthetic microbes for industrial applications that could reduce oil dependence and mitigate carbon emissions.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

Animal‑welfare workers rescued 20 mastiffs in cramped cages en route to a slaughterhouse, finding a third already dead, no food or water for three days, and several with broken bones, a fate feared for hundreds more. Gangs and unscrupulous breeders are also offloading poor‑quality, cross‑bred dogs, while urbanization has made the large, 80‑kg, traditionally herding breed less suitable for city life. The breed’s boom began in 2005, but the market collapse has left a glut of unsellable dogs and a sharp drop in demand.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

The report, presented to the French women’s rights ministry, highlighted the invisibility of many unreported attacks and called for a campaign to curb sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains, while leaders such as Pascale Boisard and Ernestine Ronai urged that women be educated that such conduct is not normal, that aggressors and witnesses be addressed, and reminded that sexual assault carries a five‑year prison term and a €75,005 fine.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

The funding, authorised after the Home Secretary allowed PCCs to commission victim‑support services, has been criticised as a conflict of interest and “inappropriate,” with Labour’s Keith Vaz calling it a “soap opera” and arguing that PCCs should not use public funds for organisations in which they have a stake. Baird insists all MOJ procedures were followed, while Sim has announced her retirement in June amid past bullying allegations and a broader concern that the charity’s partial run by a former bullying‑accused chief constable may deter victims from seeking help.

Depay, who began his career at VV Moordrecht and Sparta Rotterdam before joining PSV at 12, is known for his pace, close control, dribbling, powerful right‑foot shooting and ability to cut inside from the left wing, though he can still make poor passes or hold the ball too long. He earned his first Dutch cap in 2013, was part of the 2014 World Cup squad that finished third, scored the winning goal against Australia, and was nominated for the tournament’s best young player award. Van Gaal, who used Depay in the 2014 World Cup, and former Dutch star Phillip Cocu have praised his potential to rival players like Arjen Robben and even Cristiano Ronaldo at a young age.","company":"openai","model_name":"gpt-oss-20b","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-05","temperature":0.01,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"gpu","endpoint":"chat","reasoning_effort":null}

He reports that a typical heterosexual couple now has sex about three times a month, down from four times in 2000 and five times in 1990. Spiegelhalter attributes the drop to people living alone and, more realistically, to the erosion of boundaries between work, home and social life, which leaves less quiet time for intimacy.
