The investigation focused on ditched enclosures, now revealed due to modern deforestation, which were previously hidden by rainforest. Over 450 large geometrical structures, known as \"geoglyphs,\" were found. The purpose of these sites is still a mystery, but they are not believed to be villages or defensive structures due to the lack of artefacts and their layout. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests the geoglyphs were constructed within tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research challenges previous assumptions about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial gathering of diverse plant species over millennia.

The study, tracking 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998, found that poverty is a significant factor in youth offending and victimization. It also identified a strong link between a history of police involvement and a young person's likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training by age 18. Gender was another powerful predictor, with boys being more prone to violence, and girls from poorer backgrounds facing higher risks of involvement in violent crime. The findings suggest that poverty and contact with the juvenile justice system create a cycle that exacerbates violence and poverty-related risks. Despite Scotland's overall crime rate being at a 41-year low, the benefits of this reduction are not evenly distributed, with deprived communities still experiencing high crime rates and associated issues like chronic health problems and unemployment.

These earthworks consist of over 450 large geometrical structures called \"geoglyphs,\" hidden for centuries by rainforests until recent deforestation revealed them. The function of these sites remains a mystery, but they are thought to have been used for ritual gatherings rather than as villages or defensive structures. Dr. Loader's analysis of soil samples suggests that the geoglyphs were constructed in tall vegetation, unlike other ritual sites, and were likely not visible above the forest canopy. The research also challenges previous beliefs about the Amazonian forests, indicating human influence through the artificial spread of various plant species over millennia. The team compares the ancient practices to a \"prehistoric supermarket\" of useful forest products and suggests that modern biodiversity in the region may still reflect these ancient agroforestry techniques.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-r", "date_code": "08-2024", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}
