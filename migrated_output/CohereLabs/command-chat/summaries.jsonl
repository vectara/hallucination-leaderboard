He also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off.\n\nAfter the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same.

However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible.\n\nBut the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty.\n\nBut he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour.

The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21.\n\nGraham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission.\n\n'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.'\n\nOnly 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.\n\n'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.'\n\nA draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches.

Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \"reckless\" for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was upheld.\n\nNorth was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.\n\nHughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27. Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April. Most migrants come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said.\n\nThe recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy has put a strain on Italian resources. The Italian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and some have called for the European Union to do more to help.\n\nThe European Union has responded by increasing funding for border control and rescue operations. However, some critics say that the EU is not doing enough to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty and conflict in Africa.\n\nThe migrant crisis is a complex and challenging issue. There is no easy solution, but it is important to understand the causes of the crisis and to work together to find a solution.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The plane is believed to have cost £400 million.\n\nThe lounge is decorated like a luxury hotel, with comfortable seating and a large TV. The master bedroom has a huge bed, an armchair, and a sofa. The conference room is perfect for meetings in the sky, with its long table and comfortable chairs. The executive room can be used as an office or a guest bedroom. The main suite is decorated with over-the-top decorations and could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel. The dining room is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef. The plane also has a number of areas set aside for guests to relax while watching television. The main state room also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation. The lounge is a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience. Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights. The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies. The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one, which can hold up to 600 passengers.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

This shifts the power from Planning Service, a Stormont agency, to local councils. This is seen as a positive move towards democracy by some, including Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE. He argues that it offers local councils the opportunity to develop community and development plans. \n\nOthers are not so optimistic. There are concerns that a strict code of conduct will need to be enforced in order to ensure the handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent. There are also worries that the move could lead to a repeat of the 1960s, when local councils were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing. Friends of the Earth argue that greater transparency is needed in terms of political donations. Others oppose the move as they believe it will deter donors. \n\nOverall, there is both optimism and caution about the planned changes to the planning system in Northern Ireland.", "company": "CohereLabs", "model_name": "command-chat", "date_code": "", "eval_name": "pre_2025-07", "summary_date": "pre_2025-07"}

The guard, who was not identified, was taking up position in his sentry box when he lost his footing and slid sideways. He knocked his bearskin on the side of the box and dropped his rifle. The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard.

At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses.\n\nMinisters refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.\n\nKeith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’\n\nThe problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system.\n\nMinisters agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time.\n\nDetails obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office.\n\nIn total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1.\n\nThe Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’.\n\nIt can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’\n\nHome Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved.\n\nThis newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back.\n\nAmong those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades.\n\nHM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year.

The busiest times are unsurprisingly during large sporting events, such as the American Superbowl or the Monaco Grand Prix. This is especially true when these events are hosted in smaller cities, increasing the demand for private jets. For example, during the Superbowl this year, PrivateFly (a private jet charter company) estimated the cost of travelling by medium jet from New York to Glendale at $ 38,000 return, or $ 54,000 for a long-range jet. The richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, based on the 767-400 aircraft, and surprisingly, three of the top ten are in Japan. Haneda airport, Tokyo, charges £4,559, or $6,850, to land a private jet, welcoming almost 69 million passengers a year, with a high punctuality rating. Tokyo's other airport, Narita International, charges £3,728, or $5,600 and comes second on the list, while Kansai International, Osaka, charges £3,594, or $5,400.
