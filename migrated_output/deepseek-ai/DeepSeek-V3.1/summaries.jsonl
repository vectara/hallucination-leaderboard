A record 46.8 million people were registered for the 8 June election, with a 68.7% turnout, the highest since 1997. A surge in applications after the snap election was called resulted in 2.9 million submissions, but a net increase of only 1.4 million registrations indicated a significant proportion (30-70% in different areas) were duplicates. This was due to the lack of a direct link between the online registration service and local registers, making it difficult for people to check their status. The watchdog recommended clearer information on registration sites and a verification function. While there was no evidence to support claims of widespread double voting, the Commission stressed it is a serious offence. Labour warned against a blanket ban on being registered at two addresses, arguing it would disenfranchise students and others who need to be registered in two places for work or study.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.1","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-25","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

This update now requires the two-step process—which sends a code to a trusted device after a login attempt—to be used when accessing iCloud backups, a feature that was previously not protected in this way. While the system is an opt-in choice, an expert suggests it should be the default. The owner of the software used in the hacks, Elcomsoft, acknowledged that Apple's changes effectively block his tool and that users now get email notifications when a backup download starts. However, he expressed concerns that the 14-character recovery key could be lost or stolen. Another expert advocated for making two-factor authentication the default standard for all companies, not just Apple. Apple's CEO stated the company plans to more aggressively encourage users to turn on the feature and use stronger passwords, emphasizing the need for increased awareness.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.1","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-25","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}

The author argues that England coach Stuart Lancaster must be free to select his best players, like Stuart Lancaster must for rugby, regardless of where they play, citing the improved performances of Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Steffon Armitage, and Nick Abendanon since moving to France. The core point is that for a home World Cup, England must pick its absolute best team to win and avoid future regrets, and it is misguided to let other bodies dictate selection rules that other top nations like South Africa and Wales do not follow.","company":"deepseek-ai","model_name":"DeepSeek-V3.1","date_code":"","eval_name":"live","summary_date":"2025-08-25","temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1024,"thinking_tokens":null,"execution_mode":"api","endpoint":"chat"}
