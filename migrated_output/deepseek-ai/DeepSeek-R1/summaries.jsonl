Critics accused the BBC of overhyping a product, but the author defended it as a potential societal shift, likening it to the Model T Ford—a comparison he later questioned but now finds valid. The iPhone revolutionized mobile technology, embedding powerful computers in over 2 billion smartphones, disrupting industries like photography by simplifying access and sharing (contrasting a 2007 DSLR photo with a 2017 iPhone shot). Steve Jobs' focus on intuitive design made advanced features mainstream, transforming phones into multifunctional tools.

The bailout’s success hinges on creditors offering significant debt relief (30-50% reduction) to restore growth, but Germany and the EU must avoid triumphalism and prioritize debt forgiveness over punitive measures.
